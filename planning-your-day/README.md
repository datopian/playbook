# Planning Your Day

A document structure for regularly planning your day. Aim is to generate insight and data for rapid learning and improvement esp in estimation and implementation.

# Backlog (of your specific tasks)

*Note: you don't need to duplicate stuff in a board - if something is already in board then leave there - this is just for extra things*

# Learnings

*For bigger longer-term learnings*

Date these e.g.

2018-07-02

# Daily Template

> Key point: every day you have a list of planned tasks with estimates and you see how you do => you strengthen your planning muscle, you identify blockers/questions early

:::warning
NOT in order. You can do these when you want. What i do suggest is standup is done night before - before you end for day.
:::

*Have a section for each day dated and in reverse order*

Points out of 10

* 3 points for doing prep and analysis (3 out of 3 = perfect, no corrections, on time etc)
* 7 points for performance =
  * 4 points for percentage you got done
  * 3 points for how you felt (you were well and balanced, content, challenged (positively), and not too tired)

* [ ] End of day note at top of the day
  * [ ] Percentage of planned tasks that got done + summary score out of 10
  * [ ] Quick retrospective on learnings from the day - what worked and what did not work so well
    * [ ] Add major ones to the learnings section
* [ ] Build plan for next day (this can also be standup)
  * [ ] Includes analysis

In setting out your plan suggest two groups:

Big items (try and get specific so you easily evaluate whether this happened or not)

* [ ] Work on email sending, specifically complete research on options and post in issue)

Misc (small) items e.g.

* [ ] Call xxx
* [ ] Email yyy
* [ ] Do plan and review
