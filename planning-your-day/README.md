# Planning Your Day

A document structure for regularly planning your day to support rapid learning and improvement, especially in estimation and implementation.

## Structure

We suggest the follow main sections in the doc, in order:

* Backlog (optional)
* Learnings
* Daily Plans

We give more detail on each section below.

## Backlog

This is Backlog of your specific tasks.

:::tip
You don't need to duplicate stuff in a board - if something is already in board then leave there. This is just for extra things or for a quick braindump. Regularly empty it!
:::

## Learnings

For bigger longer-term learnings. Recommend grouping these by date e.g.

2018-07-02

* What I learned X
* What I learned Y

## Daily Plans

These are plans (and outcomes for each day). Fast and simple to do.

Intention: every day you have a list of planned tasks with estimates and you see how you do => you strengthen your planning muscle, you identify blockers/questions early

Each daily plan:

* Gets its own subsection with a heading with the date.
* Most recent day at the top.
* Two sections to the daily plan:
  * Plan for the day (usually done previous night or first thing in the day)
  * End of day note including a score
    * [ ] Percentage of planned tasks that got done + summary score out of 10
    * [ ] Quick retrospective on learnings from the day - what worked and what did not work so well
      * [ ] Add major ones to the learnings section

:::tip
You can use todoist or similar todo app for this if you wish. But you must be able to share with your coach or scrum-master.

### Scoring your day

Points out of 10

* 3 points for doing prep and analysis (3 out of 3 = perfect, no corrections, on time etc)
* 7 points for performance =
  * 4 points for percentage you got done
  * 3 points for how you felt (you were well and balanced, content, challenged (positively), and not too tired)

### Plan for the day

In setting out your plan suggest two groups:

Big items (try and get specific so you easily evaluate whether this happened or not). Example:

```
* [ ] Work on email sending, specifically complete research on options and post in issue
```

Misc (small) items e.g.

```
* [ ] Call xxx
* [ ] Email yyy
* [ ] Do plan and review
```
