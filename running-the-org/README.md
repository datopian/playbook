## Expenses and Travel

:::warning
You must submit your expenses from the business trip as soon as possible, ideally, within 10 working days after the trip. Expenses submitted later than 5 months will not be paid. The same rule applies to non-travel expenses.

If you have any company expenses to be reimbursed for:

### German Employees

#### Submitting expenses

* Submit your expenses to Datopian GmbH by following the procedure above.
* After every business trip, you must also fill out and submit the [Per diem expense form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17bcyifuPuegLSgWNdgdEhIcmoNu2iedy/view) (more info below) along with the other travel expenses.
  * The best way to do that is to download the form on your computer in order to have it calculated automatically (once you enter the rates).
  * Make sure to tick the breakfast / lunch / dinner boxes if they were included in the accommodation.

#### Travel policy

1. Fill out the [Per diem form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17bcyifuPuegLSgWNdgdEhIcmoNu2iedy/view) according to the [International per diem rates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17SAisgQp3BWzHOkNu54BmgUYVOUs9tnH/view) as follows:
    * Anlass: Name of the event
    * Land/Ort: City/Country
    * Tagessatz: This is the per diem rate defined for the country you will be in. You can check these rates [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17SAisgQp3BWzHOkNu54BmgUYVOUs9tnH/view) (page 4).
      * The day of arrival and departure is always counted as half-day (the number in the second/middle column).
      * Eg. If you were in Gambia, you would get.
        * 30 EUR for a full day (24 hrs) (if no meals are included in your accommodation).
        * 20 EUR for a half day (more than 8 hours, less than 24).
2. Upload the Per diem form in Xero along with the rest of your trip expenses (as described above).
3. Make sure to mark them all and submit them for approval.
4. Send an email to [Office Requests](mailto:incoming+datopian-office-office-requests-14747497-5cl6vuzhmxhbsbmy20tqb8lak-issue@incoming.gitlab.com) and CC office@datopian.com confirming that your expenses have been submitted.

### Core Hours

Our general working hours are 8am UK -- 5pm UK. Not necessarily when you work but when it is permissible to schedule meetings.

### Phone book

### Time-off

Remember, we're not a traditional organization and we practice self-management and self-organizing. Thus, time-off is not something approved by your "boss" (who is your boss?). Rather it is something to discuss and negotiate with your peers and overall resourcing coordination team as they are the ones affected.

In short, we ask that you be mindful of business priorities when choosing which days to take off and that you liaise with your colleagues and team, especially with the scrum master and product owner on any projects you are involved in.

Whilst there is no hard and fast rules we recommend giving reasonable notice, for example for a two week break something like 2 months notice in would be recommended.

How to organize time-off:

* Discuss with your project team(s) and especially with the Scrum Master and Product Owner.
* Once agreed notify resourcing@datopian.com to inform them about the dates of your absence and so they can flag if any issues.
* Make sure to add your holiday dates in both the Datopian Team calendar as well as in your own personal calendar.

### If You're Ill

If you’re not feeling well and you’re unable to work, notify your Scrum Master / Product Owner as soon as possible. The notified person will then let teammates know.

Please add an "Out of office" and include an alternative contact.

## Password Management

All Datopian credentials are stored in Bitwarden. Please reach out to the Ops team (office@datopian.com) if you need access to any accounts. Once confirmed, an account in Bitwarden or relevant application (e.g. Heroku) will be created for you with the appropriate access.

### Registering for New Services/ Portals
