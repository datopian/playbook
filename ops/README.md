# Onboarding Ops Guide


## Principles

The Onboarding process has been designed to be lean and simple; both a self-service guide for the onboarder and onboardee. 

There may be occasions where the Ops team is requested to produce contract and initiate onboarding process and this guide includes a process for a requestor to request a contract/onboarding process. 


## User stories

* Onboarder / Onboarding Manager = person setting up New Joiner (Needs to be authorised)
* Requestor = Team member or management requesting 

**As the Onboarder** I want to know what I need to do for and with the Onboardee and that I've done it all so that Onboardee is set up and supported and I don't miss things out.

**As Requestor**, I want to know what to provide the Onboarding team with to get a contract for new contractor and start onboarding process so that the Onboarder has the information they need and new contractors get their contracts and are onboarded swiftly.

* Things i need to do before the Onboardee starts their onboarding (e.g. ensure they have a contract)
* Things to do during onboarding
* Things to do after onboarding


## Create and Sign the Contract

The contract should be signed within **3 working days**, unless otherwise agreed with the the person that interviewed the staff member. Within those 3 days, staff member can address questions and we will try as much as possible to get them resolved.

### Before Onboarding

:::warning
These steps can be done in parallel or out of order.

However, unless otherwise agreed, we should only do these steps **once there is a signed contract**.
:::

1. **GSuite Account and Email:** Create their email account as first.last@datopian.com on Google Admin page and share the login details via email (part of email creation wizard in google apps). After you have created the account, make sure you assign a G Suite Business license, so that the contractor can use all the G Suite features and access Google drives.

2. **Create accounts / send invitations** on systems where they can't create themselves

    * Xero - with their company email address;

2. **Welcome email:** Send them the welcome email to their new personal email and their Datopian email.

3. **Welcome Call**: Send them an invitation for a Welcome Call within the next days. If this before their start date make sure you check their availability for the call.

5. **Add the person to the Rates DB & Inter-org DB**: Complete the [Rates DB sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fXs_pdpW2QL7FKfYcVW-nXcLoXiywx3bPaA8RufFDeI/edit) using the rates in their contract. Fill in : the **daily rate**, the **currency** and the **daily rate in USD**. (The hourly and monthly rates should automatically calculate). Once completed, inform the Head of Project so they can add them to the [InterOrg Rates DB](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J0J2Rpb_v_Fp1LzBDNHn6EDzhLpuSovNqRrL_HOwQRg/edit#gid=0). 

6. If a GmbH employee -- add them to HeavenHR or whatever HR platform we are currently using
