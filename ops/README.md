# Onboarding Ops Guide


## Principles

The Onboarding process has been designed to be lean and simple; both a self-service guide for the onboarder and onboardee. 

There may be occasions where the Ops team is requested to produce contract and initiate onboarding process and this guide includes a process for a requestor to request a contract/onboarding process. 


## User stories

* Onboarder / Onboarding Manager = person setting up New Joiner (Needs to be authorised)
* Requestor = Team member or management requesting 

**As the Onboarder** I want to know what I need to do for and with the Onboardee and that I've done it all so that Onboardee is set up and supported and I don't miss things out.

**As Requestor**, I want to know what to provide the Onboarding team with to get a contract for new contractor and start onboarding process so that the Onboarder has the information they need and new contractors get their contracts and are onboarded swiftly.

* Things i need to do before the Onboardee starts their onboarding (e.g. ensure they have a contract)
* Things to do during onboarding
* Things to do after onboarding


## Create and Sign the Contract

The contract should be signed within **3 working days**, unless otherwise agreed with the the person that interviewed the staff member. Within those 3 days, staff member can address questions and we will try as much as possible to get them resolved.

0. [Optional] Request a contract be created
1. Create the contract and update with key terms
3. Email the contractor to review and fill in
4. Both parties sign
5. Email contract and office@ with the signed PDF and stored into Drive
6. Notify onboarder contract signed

### Request Contract Creation

If the Ops team should create the contract (and initiate the onboarding process) fill in [this form &raquo;](https://goo.gl/forms/nX7SZe379gdN2xfp2)

### Create the Contract

1. Create a folder for the person on the HR drive (People/[Contracts and staff files](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1MbeZVuRM-A1Cu01bfm_aRDvsusJAxglF))
2. Create a draft contract:
    1. Copy the template contract which is stored [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1VoHxI-6vdv2skCsRA5uRLu8S7X0-ikvD)
    2. Move it to the Person's folder in HR Drive you created in Step 1
    3. Rename it to `Datopian (Viderum inc. trading as) - {Contractor Name} - Contractor Agreement`
    4. Fill in any relevant sections and especially the key terms in the Schedule section
    5. Highlight everything that needs to be filled out by the onboardee
    6. [Optional] Insert signature (if we are not doing DocuSign). We are happy to do this as key terms are already agreed and we will review before making final PDF.

### Contractor Reviews

1. In Google Docs click Share and share with the contractor's personal email.
    * Make sure to tick "Skip sending notification" as you will notify them by email in the next step.
2. Email the contractor with an email like the following

    Subject: Your Datopian Contract: Please Review and Complete

    ```
    Hello XXX,
     
    Welcome! This is your contract:

    {Insert Link to Google Doc} 
      
    Please review and fill in any relevant highlighted sections. If you have any questions please note these as comments in the doc. Then:

    EITHER: you have questions. If so, please email us to let us know so we can get those resolved üòÄ

#### Additional Documents required for the German HR:

* Anmeldung (residence address in Germany)
* Social security number (Sozialversicherungsnummer) 
    * Ops team needs to register them at Techniker Krankenkasse and provide all needed information for that. For a fast identification when contacting TK, you should use the following reference: 95591608 (Betriebsnummer)
    * Ask the employee to register in the TK online portal so that they can upload their sick certificates and send them to the Techniker Krankenkasse.
* Tax id (Steuernummer/SteuerID)
    * Should be obtained from the Finanzamt by the employee 
    * A residence address in Germany is required for this
* German bank account

### Sign Contract

After the contract has been filled in and signed by the contractor, the Ops team member will remove the highlighted parts, review it once more and then send it to management for final review and signature.

### Email Contract

* Make a PDF of the contract
* Store that in Drive in the contract folder for that contractor

### Before Onboarding

:::warning
These steps can be done in parallel or out of order.

However, unless otherwise agreed, we should only do these steps **once there is a signed contract**.
:::

1. **GSuite Account and Email:** Create their email account as first.last@datopian.com on Google Admin page and share the login details via email (part of email creation wizard in google apps). After you have created the account, make sure you assign a G Suite Business license, so that the contractor can use all the G Suite features and access Google drives.

2. **Create accounts / send invitations** on systems where they can't create themselves

    * Xero - with their company email address;

3. **Welcome Call**: Send them an invitation for a Welcome Call within the next days. If this before their start date make sure you check their availability for the call.

4. **Welcome email:** Send them the welcome email to their new personal email and their Datopian email.

    Subject: Welcome to Datopian - next steps in getting you set up

    ```

    **2. Welcome call**
    
    A welcome call will be scheduled. Please accept the invite üòä 
    
    If you are **unable** to make that time please let us know asap by declining the invite and suggesting an alternative time!

# Ops process for opening and tracking issues 

## User stories 
### For Opening and tracking issues for Ops 

[Link to the user stories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1woRiyVqsWNHqEMw4aodl77y-_tlT5y9pBPyo-OGE8r4/edit#heading=h.7ddreqxrmlu3)
 
### For Documentation

As Head of Operations, I want to have a place which reminds, reinforces and clarifies the office@ process, so that (i) the ops team is aligned with and knows how to manage the ops inbox efficiently and (ii) any new team member can pick it up if necessary.  

As Ops team, I want to refresh my knowledge about the opening and tracking issues process (if I need), so that I am confident in my job and have no doubts on how to process incoming requests.  

As a newly hired ops team member, I want to understand how we manage our requests in the ops team, so that I can catch up quickly and keep the machine running smoothly.  

## How it works

1. The ops team has got a Gitlab Group *(Datopian Office)* and a project inside of this group *(Office Requests)* 
2. The ops team uses the *‚ÄúEmail a new issue to this project‚Äù* option in Gitlab which generates a unique private Gitlab email address for the project
3. This email address is used from all team members for all kinds of office requests  
4. Every email sent to this Gitlab email automatically generates an issue in the Gitlab project *(Office Requests)*  
5. Ops team deals with the issue and updates the requestor via email 


## How to set it up:

1. Go to your Gmail inbox
2. Go to Contacts ‚Üí Create a new contact  

    *First Name: Office*  
    *Second Name: Requests*  
    *Email: incoming+datopian-office-office-requests-14747497-5cl6vuzhmxhbsbmy20tqb8lak-issue@incoming.gitlab.com*  
    
## How to open and track issues in Gitlab:  
### Step-by-step process  

1. A team member or management person writes to the Gitlab email which the ops team has shared with them *(the above mentioned ‚ÄúOffice Requests‚Äù Contact)* and CCs office@  
* Eg. for creating / deleting an account  
* Booking a trip  
* Sorting out submitted expenses  
* Asking questions regarding the Getting paid etc.  

2. Every email sent to the Gitlab email *(Office Requests)* directly generates an issue in the *Office Requests* Project on Gitlab   
* The email subject becomes the issue title.  
* The email body becomes the issue description.  
* Markdown and quick actions are supported.  

3. If the team member forgets and doesn‚Äôt send it to Office Requests but to office@, then:
* The ops team forwards this email to Office Requests manually and **CCs office@**  

:::warning
It is VERY important to CC office@ or else we won‚Äôt know if this has been forwarded to the Office Requests and we can end up with multiple issues for the same request
:::

* The ops team advises the team member that they should always send their requests to Office Requests going forward   

4. Every day, the ops member who is in charge of the inbox goes through the Gitlab issues and:   
* Assigns them to someone    
* Sets a deadline if necessary  
* Adjusts label *(Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)*  

5. The person who gets assigned to the issue understands what actions are required and resolves it asap  

:::tip
This project won‚Äôt be visible to other team members so the ops team deals with the issues internally and provides updates to the requestor via email.
:::

6. If the issue has been resolved / the request has been fulfilled, the ops member comments and/or sends an email to the requestor and closes the Gitlab issue.  
* There is an actual button ‚ÄúComment and close issue‚Äù  
* Don‚Äôt forget to update the label from ‚ÄúIn progress‚Äù to ‚ÄúDone‚Äù
