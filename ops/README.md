# Onboarding Ops Guide


## Principles

The Onboarding process has been designed to be lean and simple; both a self-service guide for the onboarder and onboardee. 

There may be occasions where the Ops team is requested to produce contract and initiate onboarding process and this guide includes a process for a requestor to request a contract/onboarding process. 


## User stories

* Onboarder / Onboarding Manager = person setting up New Joiner (Needs to be authorised)
* Requestor = Team member or management requesting 

**As the Onboarder** I want to know what I need to do for and with the Onboardee and that I've done it all so that Onboardee is set up and supported and I don't miss things out.

**As Requestor**, I want to know what to provide the Onboarding team with to get a contract for new contractor and start onboarding process so that the Onboarder has the information they need and new contractors get their contracts and are onboarded swiftly.

* Things i need to do before the Onboardee starts their onboarding _(e.g. ensure they have a contract)_
* Things to do during onboarding
* Things to do after onboarding


## Process for requesting contract/onboarding

## Onboarder’s manual

### Before Onboarding

*Note these steps do not always need to be done in the order list. Unless otherwise agreed, we should never onboard someone before they have a signed contract. The minimum constraint on the procedure needs to be a signed contract before any other onboarding*. 

**1. Create a folder for the person on the HR drive (People/[Contracts and staff files](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1MbeZVuRM-A1Cu01bfm_aRDvsusJAxglF)) and draft a contract:** 

* Template contracts are stored [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1VoHxI-6vdv2skCsRA5uRLu8S7X0-ikvD). 
* Highlight everything that needs to be filled out by the onboardee
* Message  when sharing the contract should be: 

*“Hello XXX,
 
 Welcome! This is your contract.. 
 
 Please feel free to read it and note any questions you might have. 
 
 Please review and/ or fill in the highlighted sections. Once this is done, we will send you the contract via DocuSign for you to sign. 
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Many thanks,
 
 XXX”*


* After the onboardee has filled in the highlighted fields and has gotten all of theyre questions answered, then we proceed to send them the contract via Docusign so they may sign it electronically.
* Create a trello card (copy content from previous onboarding cards)

*Unless otherwise agreed, we should never onboard someone before they have a signed contract. The minimum constraint on the procedure needs to be a signed contract before any other onboarding.*

**2. GSuite Account and Email:** Create their email account e.g. first.last@domain.com on Google Admin page and share the login details via email (part of email creation wizard in google apps); After you have created the account, make sure you assign a G Suite Business license, so that the contractor can use all the G Suite features and access Google drives.

**3. Onboarding email:** Send them onboarding email to their new personal email cc'ing their company email. Send them at least 2 invitations for Onboarding calls within the next days (depending on the starting date of the person)

**4. Create accounts / send invitations** on systems where they can't create themselves

* Xero - with their company email address;
* Slack - with their company email address and only if previously requested;

**5. Add the person to the Rates DB & Inter-org DB**: Complete the [Rates DB sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fXs_pdpW2QL7FKfYcVW-nXcLoXiywx3bPaA8RufFDeI/edit) using the rates in their contract. Fill in : the **daily rate**, the **currency** and the **daily rate in USD**. (The hourly and monthly rates should automatically calculate). Once completed, inform the Head of Project so they can add them to the [InterOrg Rates DB](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J0J2Rpb_v_Fp1LzBDNHn6EDzhLpuSovNqRrL_HOwQRg/edit#gid=0). 

**6. If a GmbH employee -- add them to HeavenHR or whatever HR platform we are currently using**

Wait for them to get setup on Systems then:

**7. Add them to teams**:
    * Trello: add to Org team
    * G Chat: add to relevant channels (if applicable)
    * Gitter: add to relevant channels (if applicable)
    * Github: add as a member of the org, add to relevant teams (Add user to our GitHub organisation and the ‘Everyone’ team)(if applicable)
    * Gitlab: add as a member of the org, add to relevant teams
    * G Suite / Drive: add them to relevant team drives and google groups by adding them to Service team.
