# Onboarding Ops Guide


## Principles

The Onboarding process has been designed to be lean and simple; both a self-service guide for the onboarder and onboardee. 

There may be occasions where the Ops team is requested to produce contract and initiate onboarding process and this guide includes a process for a requestor to request a contract/onboarding process. 


## User stories

* Onboarder / Onboarding Manager = person setting up New Joiner (Needs to be authorised)
* Requestor = Team member or management requesting 

**As the Onboarder** I want to know what I need to do for and with the Onboardee and that I've done it all so that Onboardee is set up and supported and I don't miss things out.

**As Requestor**, I want to know what to provide the Onboarding team with to get a contract for new contractor and start onboarding process so that the Onboarder has the information they need and new contractors get their contracts and are onboarded swiftly.

* Things i need to do before the Onboardee starts their onboarding (e.g. ensure they have a contract)
* Things to do during onboarding
* Things to do after onboarding


## Create and Sign the Contract

The contract should be signed within **3 working days**, unless otherwise agreed with the the person that interviewed the staff member. Within those 3 days, staff member can address questions and we will try as much as possible to get them resolved.

### Before Onboarding

:::warning
These steps can be done in parallel or out of order.

However, unless otherwise agreed, we should only do these steps **once there is a signed contract**.
:::

1. **GSuite Account and Email:** Create their email account as first.last@datopian.com on Google Admin page and share the login details via email (part of email creation wizard in google apps). After you have created the account, make sure you assign a G Suite Business license, so that the contractor can use all the G Suite features and access Google drives.

2. **Create accounts / send invitations** on systems where they can't create themselves

    * Xero - with their company email address;

3. **Welcome Call**: Send them an invitation for a Welcome Call within the next days. If this before their start date make sure you check their availability for the call.

4. **Welcome email:** Send them the welcome email to their new personal email and their Datopian email.

    Subject: Welcome to Datopian - next steps in getting you set up

    ```

### Welcome Call

Here is the suggested agenda for the Welcome Call with the new Datopian. The first two sections should usually take no more than an hour.

:::tip
The Onboarder should use the onboarding meeting doc to capture questions. The Onboarder can forward to other team members any questions they don’t know the answer to, for example technical questions.
:::

**Welcome**

* Introduce yourself, confirm that you are the onboarder [5m]
* Get them to intro themselves [2-3m per person e.g. 15m for 5 ppl]
* Expectation and requests from them [10m]

**What this call is about -- intro to onboarding and company context**

* We’ve designed the onboarding process to be a self-service one but I’m just going to say a few words to intro you to the company
* Overview of the company
  * What we do
  * Team is global and fully remote. We have team members all over the world from London to Bangalore, New York to Berlin, Kazachstan to Portugal.
  * Flat, self-organizing self-managing organisational set-up [very brief but this informs the nature of this onboarding process even!]
* Who they will be working with / Apprentice program [intro Appr Progam Course Lead]
* Talk about Values & Culture briefly – emphasize we will come back to this and we wanted to flag this now as our emphasis on culture is an important and distinctive part of our approach
  * Why that’s important to us
  * Example: Integrity

**Onboarding**

Here, the Onboarder is are largely following the structure of the [Onboarding Guide](/onboarding/).

* Check that they have done prerequisites [15m]
  * They have access to email
  * Drives
  * Making sure they are all set - no blockers
* Housekeeping [15m] (for Apprentices)
  * How much time have they got today => Schedule end of day of meeting if possible
  * When are they available this week.
  * Schedule the apprentice welcome meeting if not already scheduled
* First steps [onboardees / apprentices on their own] => follow the onboarding guide and read the first steps. Check in with them regularly [2h]
* Reference reading [2h]
* Homework:
  * Practice markdown and git if you haven’t done that before (do the markdown exercises)
  * Culture reading on "Value Free Approach to Values" (linked from the culture page)
  * Do the quiz (if not done already)


### After Welcome Call

You MAY want to have a meeting a week after Onboarding to catch up and see how the new team member is doing. You should use this opportunity to clarify any unanswered questions as well and to provide feedback regarding the Datopian Quiz.
