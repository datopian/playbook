# Onboarding Ops Guide


## Principles

The Onboarding process has been designed to be lean and simple; both a self-service guide for the onboarder and onboardee. 

There may be occasions where the Ops team is requested to produce contract and initiate onboarding process and this guide includes a process for a requestor to request a contract/onboarding process. 


## User stories

* Onboarder / Onboarding Manager = person setting up New Joiner (Needs to be authorised)
* Requestor = Team member or management requesting 

**As the Onboarder** I want to know what I need to do for and with the Onboardee and that I've done it all so that Onboardee is set up and supported and I don't miss things out.

**As Requestor**, I want to know what to provide the Onboarding team with to get a contract for new contractor and start onboarding process so that the Onboarder has the information they need and new contractors get their contracts and are onboarded swiftly.

* Things i need to do before the Onboardee starts their onboarding _(e.g. ensure they have a contract)_
* Things to do during onboarding
* Things to do after onboarding


## Process for requesting contract/onboarding

## Onboarder’s manual

### Before Onboarding

*Note these steps do not always need to be done in the order list. E.g. sometimes getting a formal contract completed may take some time and their email can be set up and and onboarding can start prior to the contract being signed*. 


1. **Contract:** Ensure they have a contract set up (and signed) - Template contracts are stored in the HR/Contracts folder.
2. **Message  when sharing the contract should be:** 

  “Hello XXX,
 
 Welcome! This is your contract.. 
 
 Please feel free to read it and note any questions you might have. 
 
 Please review and/ or fill in the highlighted sections and have it prepared by the time of your Onboarding call. 
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Many thanks,
 
 XXX”_
    
2. **GSuite Account and Email:** Create their email account e.g. first.last@domain.com on Google Apps and share the login details via email (part of email creation wizard in google apps)
3. **Onboarding email:** Send them onboarding email to their new personal email cc'ing their company email
4. **Create accounts / send invitations** on systems where they can't create themselves

   * Xero - with their company email address;
   * Slack - with their company email address

Wait for them to get setup on Systems then:

5. **Add them to teams**:

    * Trello: add to Org team
    * Slack: add to relevant channels
    * Gitter: add to relevant channels (if applicable)
    * Github: add as a member of the org, add to relevant teams (Add user to our GitHub organisation and the ‘Everyone’ team)
    * Gitlab: add as a member of the org, add to relevant teams
    * GSuite / Drive: add them to relevant team drives and google groups


### Welcome Email

**Subject: Welcome to Datopian - next steps in getting you set up**

_Hi {XXX},_

_Welcome to Datopian._

_In preparation for the onboarding call on :_

**_1. Your Datopian Email_**

_We have created a Viderum email for you. You should have already received an email about this with details of how to sign in and set your password._

_For best practice security reasons, we use 2fa on all Viderum Google Accounts._

_To enable 2fa for your account, ensure you are logged in to your Viderum account, and follow the steps here._

_If you do not know what 2fa is, do not worry! You can also read more about 2fa here and here._

_To support your use of 2fa, we recommend installing Authenticator on your smartphone._


_Need to mention 2 factor authentication. Find Paul’s email (where he announced the 2fa policy) and include the links._

**_2. Set up your Slack account_**

_Please do that as soon as possible and confirm to office@datopian.com that you have set up your email so that we can invite you set up a slack account. Once your Slack is set up, use Slack to message your onboarder so they can welcome you to the team._

**_2. Our onboarding call_**

_An onboarding call has been scheduled. An invite has been sent to your Viderum calendar and email! If that time does not work please let us know._

_Also, talking of meetings, we have a weekly all hands, this should already be in your calendar._

**_3. Start inducting yourself!_**

_We have designed the onboarding process to be largely self-service so you can set yourself up! We are in the process of merging Datopian and Viderum so where you see Datopian please read Viderum._

_Please start working your way through the Onboarding guide and induct yourself!_

_Best,_

### After Onboarding:

Have a meeting a week after Onboarding to catch up and see how new Staff Member is adapting.


#### Contract completion process:


1. The contract should be signed within **3 working days**, unless otherwise agreed with the the person that interviewed the staff member. 
    * Within those 3 days, staff member can address questions and we will try as much as possible to get them resolved.
 
2. After the contract has been filled in and signed, the Ops team member will remove the highlighted parts, review it once more and then send it to management for signature.

3. After it has been signed, export it to _PDF_ and save it in the Staff members file in [HR Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ABL_avmhZBFiUk9PVA).
