# Dojo ü•ã

The dojo at Datopian is our space for training and development.

> The word d≈çj≈ç originates from Buddhism. Initially, d≈çj≈ç were adjunct to temples and were formal training places for any of the Japanese arts ending in "-d≈ç", from the Chinese Tao (or Dao), meaning "way" or "path". Sometimes meditation halls where Zen Buddhists practice zazen meditation were called d≈çj≈ç.[1] The alternative term zen-do is more specific, and more widely used. [Wikipedia]
