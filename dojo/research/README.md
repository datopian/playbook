# How to Do Research

Doing research provides a systematic approach to answering any type of questions from: "What is the best power bank to buy for my smartphone?" to "What is the nature of reality?", any of those questions can benefit from doing it in a structured way.

## What is Research

> Research is a **process of systematic inquiry** that entails collection of data; documentation of critical information; and analysis and interpretation of that data/information, in accordance with suitable methodologies set by specific professional fields and academic disciplines.
>
> Research is conducted to evaluate the validity of a hypothesis or an interpretive framework; to **assemble a body of substantive knowledge and findings** for sharing them in appropriate manners; and to **generate questions for further inquiries**. [^hampshire]

* **process of systematic inquiry**
  That means there is a structure to it, which we will cover with the patterns below.

* **collection of data; documentation of critical information**
  Information is gathered, collected and documented somewhere in a way it is shareable with others so they can learn from it or contribute.
  
* **analysis and interpretation of that data/information**
 From the information that was gather and collected knowledge and insights can be gained.
  
* **generate questions for further inquiries**
 By gaining more knowledge about the topic throughout the process, further questions for extended or future research can arise.

## Pattern: Breadth, then Depth

### Context

You want to research a certain question.

### Problem

If you start your search in a search engine, library, or elsewhere, there is a vast amount of information available on many subjects. A lot of the information or jargon you find might be new to you and you don't know yet which sources are good.

### Solution

You start out by doing a broad search first, i.e. breadth-first search. You want to get an overview of the land.

First step would be to open a scratchpad (e.g. in a text editor, notes app). Then you start your search, for example when using a search engine, you start out with a certain query and quickly glance over the sources and start collecting the sources that look promising by writing the links and some notes in the scratchpad.

While you are searching you might get more familiar with the language around the research topic and might get ideas for more detailed search queries and find more sources that way.

You might also start to notice patterns, sources that are often referenced or generally get a better idea when a source looks good.

Once you've identified a couple of potentially great sources, then you go in depth i.e. you now study those more closely.

## Structuring Into a Spreadsheet/DB

For the analysis part, which runs somewhat in parallel with the in depth part of your research, you want to get a structured overview that allows you and anyone new to have an overview of the data and spot any patterns present in them.

Some guidelines:

* Try to use boolean values for indicating when something is present in the data e.g. a 'supports markdown' column -> Yes/No values instead of writing 'supports markdown' as the value
* If you have 1 column which contains thea same values for all entries, then you can leave it out, it doesn't convey anything.
