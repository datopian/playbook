# How to Learn Python

Python is a scripting language, like [JavaScript](/dojo/javascript), that is quite beginner friendly because of it's simple syntax. It is used a lot by data scientists, software engineers, scientists, etc. A popular use case is for automating workflows.

Python was designed in '91 by Guido van Rossum [^history].

  > This was very nice (book) for both -- people who are new in programing and want to start somewhere and for those who already have some knowledge in python programing, as it’s very good opportunity to remember and examine your coding skills and also find some new things or new approaches to various solutions.  
  >
  > The (book) covers pretty much everything starting from assigning values to variables and creating simple "hello world" application finishing with object oriented programing and creating simple web application.
  >
  > Won’t say that (book) covers every aspect of python programing and gives you a detailed explanations for every little thing, but it makes you to do your own researches and practice as much as possible. Also provides the solutions and answers for possible bugs that one may have as a beginner or even experienced one.
  >
  > I would say that the best thing this (book) teaches besides basics of python programing, is testing your one code. Building the tests is not the funniest and easiest part in programing but it encourages to go ahead and do it.
  >
  > Overlay it’s very nice (book) to introduce to python programing and at the end one must have very nice fundament to go ahead and take next steps.
