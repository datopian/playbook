# How to Learn Javascript

Javascript is a scripting language, like [Python](dojo/python), originally designed for the Web for both client and server side. It was created in '95 by Brendan Eich [^JS-history].

In the past it had mostly been used on the client side i.e. in browsers to create and control dynamic web content e.g. interactive forms, autocomplete suggestions, animations, slideshows, ...

Nowadays with the arrival of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) Javascript has also increasingly become popular on the server side.

::: tip
Javascript is not to be confused with Java. They are 2 different languages.

> I find very useful video tutorials on YouTube channel. Guy explains things very clearly for people who have idea what react is (thought knowledge of Javascript is pretty much required).

> If you using Plotly with React, it is really useful to take a look at their own tutorials listed above.
