# Technical Writing

As a software engineer, you read a lot more than you write. This written communication doesn't happen only through code – you write in Google Chat, in issue trackers, in documentation pages, and even in Git commits! Thus, it is important to communicate effectively in English as well. Remember that many readers are not native speakers of English, so please be thoughtful with your colleagues, and take extra care when proofreading.

Google recently released a short course on Technical Writing. When you have a few spare minutes, you can browse it, take notes, and start practicing the guidelines.
