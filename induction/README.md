# Induction Guide

[[toc]]

## Intention

*The intention of this Induction Guide is to fulfil on the following user stories.*

Personas

* Inductee = New Joiner
* Inductor / Induction Manager = person setting up New Joiner

As an Inductee I want a simple step by step process to get set up (that I can do largely on my own) so that I am ready to go (and know i am ready to go)

As the Inductor I want to know what I need to do for and with the Inductee and that I've done it all so that Inductee is set up and supported and I don't miss things out

* Things i need to do before the Inductee starts their induction (e.g. ensure they have a contract)
* Things to do during induction
* Things to do after induction

## Inductor

*Note these steps need always be done in the order list. E.g. sometimes getting a formal contract completed may take some time and you can still set up their email and start induction*. 

1. Ensure they have a contract set up (and signed) - usually ops will take care of this
2. Create their email account e.g. first.last@domain.com on Google Apps and share the login details via email (part of email creation wizard in google apps)
4. Send them induction email to their new org email cc'ing their personal email (if you have it)


Subject: Welcome to Datopian - next steps in getting you set up

Hi {XXX},

Welcome to Datopian/Viderum.

In preparation for the induction call on Monday:

**1. Your Viderum Email**

We have created a Viderum email for you. You should have already received an email about this with details of how to sign in and set your password.

Please do that as soon as possible.

**2. Our induction call**

An induction call has been scheduled. An invite has been sent to your Viderum calendar and email!

If that time does not work please let us know.

**3. Start inducting yourself!**

We have designed the induction process to be largely self-service so you can set yourself up!

Please start working your way through the "Inductee"  section of the Induction:

Best,

## Inductee

*We want your feedback as new joiners! Be critical, tell us what does not work, what isn’t obvious!*

1. Login in to your email account and read your induction email

2. Read the main guide in the [Handbook][handbook] and note questions that arise in a google doc

2. Create accounts on the systems we use in order (e.g. Gravatar first so that the image is picked up by other accounts) -- see below

3. Add contact details to [Team Phonebook][phonebook] (TODO: people board - do we still use this?)

4. Message the Inductor that you have accounts set up and details in team phonebook. They will now go and add you to relevant systems ...

5. Wait until you get a response to let you know you are added to relevant systems

6. Read about your work processes for the job you do

5. Go through work “processes” in more detail; This depends on the accountability the Inductee will assume;
E.g.

    * Work sprints
    * Trello management 
    * Practice on trello (acceptance criteria, checklist, closing issues…)
    * How to take meeting notes on operation meeting notes

7. Do the induction quiz
