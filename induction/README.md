# Induction

[[toc]]

## Intention

*The intention of this Induction Guide is to fulfil on the following user stories.*

Personas

* Inductee = New Joiner
* Inductor / Induction Manager = person setting up New Joiner

As an Inductee I want a simple step by step process to get set up (that I can do largely on my own) so that I am ready to go (and know i am ready to go)

As the Inductor I want to know what I need to do for and with the Inductee and that I've done it all so that Inductee is set up and supported and I don't miss things out

* Things i need to do before the Inductee starts their induction (e.g. ensure they have a contract)
* Things to do during induction
* Things to do after induction

## Inductor

1. Ensure they have a contract set up (and signed) - usually ops will take care of this
2. Create their email account and send them details with instructions on changing their password
   * Create email e.g. first.last@domain.com (we use Google Apps)
3. Send link to induction page

TODO: Template email to send to inductee ...

## Inductee

1. Setup Google Drive

1. Read the main guide in the [Handbook][handbook] and note questions that arise in a google doc

2. Create accounts on the systems we use in order (e.g. Gravatar first so that the image is picked up by other accounts) -- see below

3. Add contact details to [Team Phonebook][phonebook] (TODO: people board - do we still use this?)

[phonebook]: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1B-1PkWZZRrNJZMsfYaJwI07Aq8vtMmFG5cmcZNQ21EY/edit#gid=0 
[peopleboard]: https://trello.com/b/TojO3JxF/people

4. Message the Inductor that you have accounts set up and details in team phonebook. They will now go and add you to relevant systems ...

5. Wait until you get a response to let you know you are added to relevant systems

6. Read about your work processes for the job you do

5. Go through work “processes” in more detail; This depends on the accountability the Inductee will assume;
E.g.

    * Work sprints
    * Trello management 
    * Practice on trello (acceptance criteria, checklist, closing issues…)
    * How to take meeting notes on operation meeting notes

7. Do the induction quiz

## Systems we use

Create an account on each of these, add your account id to the phone book ... 

* Gravatar with the email(s) you will use on other accounts (so that your profile picture shows up on those other systems)
* Github
* Gitter
