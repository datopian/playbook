# Our Culture

A culture is "the way a community or organization does things". It is the combined set of behaviours and beliefs, norms and values, artifacts and institutions that organize how the set of people in that community interact and work together. It is the basic operating system for collective being.

All culture is rooted in an (implicit) ontology: a set of beliefs about "being", about how human beings are and how they operate.

We believe that we human beings are fundamentally:

* "Complete": "perfect, whole and complete" ... with barriers to the expression of that such as fear, ignorance, delusion and craving.
* "(Cap)Able": we see people as possibilities and as able to achieve more than they (or we) can imagine
* "Curious": we want to test, discover, explore, take apart and be awed and wondrous
* "Creative": we want to build, develop, scaffold and innovate

We also think that we humans have a tendency:

* "Looking good / avoid looking bad": we often are concerned with how we appear to others -- rather than actual outcomes in reality
* "To judge": to make ourselves, others and situations "wrong", assessing them as good and bad (and also do make assessments on very little evidence)

## Ideas

* Netflix: “Highly aligned - loosely coupled”
* Common feature of the more high-tech is high / very competitive compensation
  * Netflix: we pay at the top of the range, we lose anyone who isn’t a star performer
  * Valve: our compensation is very competitive
* CLOU = Colleague Letter of Understanding. Every year, each Morning Star employee negotiates a Colleague Letter of Understanding (CLOU) with the associates who are most affected by his or her work. A CLOU (pronounced “clue”) is, in essence, an operating plan for fulfilling one’s mission. An employee may talk to 10 or more colleagues during the negotiations, with each discussion lasting 20 to 60 minutes. A CLOU can cover as many as 30 activity areas and spells out all the relevant performance metrics. All together, CLOUs delineate roughly 3,000 formal relationships among Morning Star’s full-time employees.
