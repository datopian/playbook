# Our Culture and Principles

A culture is "the way a community or organization does things". It is the combined set of behaviours and beliefs, norms and values, artifacts and institutions that organize how the set of people interact and work together. It is the basic operating system for collective being.

Culture is often implicit rather than explicit. Unlike, say, the way we prepare an invoice or we set up a laptop it is undocumented. This can make it hard for newcomers to understand and contribute to. By being more explicit about it we want to make it easier to navigate, participate and contribute.

## Ontology

All culture is rooted in an (implicit) ontology: a set of beliefs about "being", about how human beings are and how they operate.

We believe that we human beings are fundamentally:

* "Complete": "perfect, whole and complete" ... with barriers to the expression of that such as fear, ignorance, delusion and craving.
* "(Cap)Able": we see people as possibilities and as able to achieve more than they (or we) can imagine
* "Curious": we want to test, discover, explore, take apart and be awed and wondrous
* "Creative": we want to build, develop, scaffold and innovate
* "More than the mind": we are more than our thoughts or feelings. Just like we have a body, we have our thoughts and feeling but we aren't them. "Ground of being" etc.

We also think that we humans have a tendency:

* "Looking good / avoid looking bad": we often are concerned with how we appear to others -- rather than actual outcomes in reality
* "To judge": to make ourselves, others and situations "wrong" (or "right"), assessing them as good and bad (and making these assessments on very little evidence)
* "Conclusion jumpers": ...
* "Inconsistent decision makers" aka "Have multiple yous": we aren't consistent in our decision making, we have impulse control / self control issues. (I want to be healthy and i want to eat donuts). One way to can imagine at least two "yous" in decision making (and maybe more e.g. you can imagine a matrix of four between self control + impulsive and fast / slow (i.e. heuristic and reasoned)). 

## Our Principles

Please start with this **required reading** which provides essential context [A ‘Value-Free’ Approach To Values](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4VpjxPkN_XcXzRmSU5HR2lMVm8/view)

### 1. Integrity, Authenticity and Commitment to Something Bigger than Yourself

*An object has integrity when it is whole and complete. Any diminution in its wholeness and completeness results in a diminution in workability. Think of a wheel with missing spokes, it is not whole, complete. It will become out-of-round, work less well and eventually stop working entirely. Likewise, a system has integrity when it is whole and complete.*

#### Integrity

**Honouring your word** - Doing what you said you would do **or** whenever you will *not* be keeping your word you get in action restoring your word with everyone impacted. **Why is it important** - it is the bridge to workability and performance.

### Restoring integrity**

* You acknowledge the word you gave (your promise)
* You state matter of factly what happened (no justifications)
* You look at the impact on others and yourself of not keeping your word
* You say what you will put in place in future

| Steps | Example  | Example *(NOT working)* |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1. You **acknowledge** the word you gave (your promise)| *I said I would meet you for lunch at 1pm*  | Hi, hope I’m not late. | 
2. You state matter of factly what happened (no justifications) | *I arrived at 1:27pm* | *You would not believe what happened with the trains, it was a nightmare.* | 
| 3. You look at the **impact** on **others** and **yourself** of not keeping your word | *I imagine you have been concerned whether I’m coming, and probably annoyed and frustrated about my lack of punctuality and being kept waiting around. For my part, I’m stressed and rushed and feeling guilty about not respecting your time.* | *Hope you haven’t been waiting long.* | 
| You say what you will **put in place** in future. *This must be something “external” to yourself.*  | *"I will set a calendar reminder 10m before my meetings”* rather than *“I will try harder to be on time”* (this is intrinsic and we assume you tried your best this time – we always come from a place of assuming you did your best)

### Initiative 

Take initiative and responsibility. We are agile and we want everyone to take responsibility and initiative. Be bold, be responsible.

### Zen

We value judgment over rules. Patterns over processes and processes over systems. This means, for example, we put effort to explaining *why* we do things not just *how* we do things.

We value parsimony and one way to do things. We prefer fewer systems and fewer things to know. We are happy to spend time refining and automating our processes and patterns.

In short, we value Zen -- deep simplicity, nothing to add and nothing to take away. Essence, precision, elegance and rigour.

## Ideas

* Netflix: “Highly aligned - loosely coupled”
* Common feature of the more high-tech is high / very competitive compensation
  * Netflix: we pay at the top of the range, we lose anyone who isn’t a star performer
  * Valve: our compensation is very competitive
* CLOU = Colleague Letter of Understanding. Every year, each Morning Star employee negotiates a Colleague Letter of Understanding (CLOU) with the associates who are most affected by his or her work. A CLOU (pronounced “clue”) is, in essence, an operating plan for fulfilling one’s mission. An employee may talk to 10 or more colleagues during the negotiations, with each discussion lasting 20 to 60 minutes. A CLOU can cover as many as 30 activity areas and spells out all the relevant performance metrics. All together, CLOUs delineate roughly 3,000 formal relationships among Morning Star’s full-time employees.

## Summary of Dalio

Values => Goals => Identify Problems (with achieving those) => Diagnose => Design (solutions) => Do the tasks in the plan

Values => Goals => Problems => Diagnoses => Designs => Tasks

* Values = what you consider important, what you value
* Goals (?) = concrete outcomes associated with those values
* Principles = "rules / patterns" for operating in life that help you pursue your values and goals; consistent ways of acting and thinking. "Principles connect your values to your actions; they are beacons that guide your actions, and help you successfully deal with the laws of reality. It is to your principles that you turn when you face hard choices." p.7
