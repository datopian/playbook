It is the combined set of behaviours and beliefs, norms and values, artifacts and institutions that organize how the set of people interact and work together. It is the basic operating system for collective being.</p> <p>Culture is often implicit rather than explicit. It is usually undocumented, unlike, say, the way to prepare an invoice or to set up a laptop. This is our attempt to document our culture, to make it more explicit and therefore to make it easier to navigate, participate in and contribute to, especially for newcomers.</p> <p>At Datopian we stand for an extraordinary culture and we are an enterprise where culture comes first.</p> <h2 id="ontology"><a href="#ontology" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ontology</h2> <p>All culture is rooted in an (implicit) ontology: a set of beliefs about “being”, that is, how human beings are and how they operate.</p> <p>We believe that we human beings are fundamentally:</p> <ul><li><strong>Complete</strong>: “perfect, whole and complete”… with barriers to the expression of that such as fear, ignorance, delusion and craving.</li> <li><strong>Great</strong>: we see people as possibilities and as able to achieve more than they (or we) can imagine</li> <li><strong>Curious</strong>: we want to test, discover, explore, take apart and be awed and wondrous</li> <li><strong>Creative</strong>: we want to build, develop, scaffold and innovate</li> <li><strong>More than mind</strong>: we are more than our thoughts or feelings. Just like we have a body, we have our thoughts and feeling but we aren’t just them.</li></ul> <p>In short, we believe we all have “buddha-nature”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> and it is there to be unlocked (not made!).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p> <p>We also believe that much that gets in the way of realising that nature: fear, ignorance, delusion, craving, anger etc. In particular, and especially relevant for us as an organization, we believe we humans have a tendency to:</p> <ul><li><strong>Looking good / avoiding looking bad</strong>: we often are concerned with how we appear to others – rather than actual outcomes in reality.</li> <li><strong>Judging</strong>: to make ourselves, others and situations “wrong” (or “right”), assessing them as good and bad (and making these assessments on very little evidence).</li> <li><strong>Story-making</strong>: we make up narrative and stories about people and situations and these stories are distinct from “what (actually) happened”. These stories are very powerful and rapidly start to frame and color what we see like a pair of tinted glasses.</li> <li><strong>Being inconsistent / Lacking self-control</strong>: we aren’t consistent in our decision making, we have impulse control / self control issues that mean we struggle to maintain committed to choices especially the choices most beneficial to us. For example, you may have decided you want to get fit and deeply want that but when the alarm goes off at 6:30am for your early morning run you hit the snooze button. Or you know you want to go bed early so you are fresh tomorrow but when the next episode option comes up on netflix you hit yes.

Humility</strong>: “Humility teaches that there are things we need to do that we cannot do on our own. Only humility can teach us that the most important things we need to learn require fundamental changes in our behavior and outlook. Humility itself, for example, can’t be attained by reading a book or taking a class. Humility requires a change of heart rather than a change of mind. Working with Mobley was a humbling experience, and if humility was the only thing I learned it was more than enough.”</p> <p><strong>2. Action bias</strong>: seeking out coaching, taking action on the coaching provided.</p> <p><strong>3. Willingness to surrender control</strong>: “Even when we do find a mentor we often put him/her in an impossible situation. We implicitly insist that we will only give up control once we have seen results. In fact we only get results if we are willing to give up control. Unwillingness to surrender control is the single biggest reason for the lamentable fact that most authentic change is precipitated by a crisis. Ironically, the reason why most of us need a coach in the first place is to learn how to give up control. I often hear the argument that being coachable is a dangerous trait unless we are “certain” that we have the right coach. But while I am sympathetic, authentic change is a journey into the unknown, and a journey into the unknown is by definition a journey into uncertainty. Insisting on certainty is just another bogus constraint we impose to stay off the hook.”</p> <h4 id="karate-kid"><a href="#karate-kid" class="header-anchor">#</a> Karate Kid</h4> <p>These two clips from Karate Kid exemplify the willingness to surrender control and learn from a mentor:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMCsXl9SGgY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMCsXl9SGgY<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg21M2zwG9Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg21M2zwG9Q<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></li></ul> <h3 id="integrous"><a href="#integrous" class="header-anchor">#</a> Integrous</h3> <p><em>See below in Our Principles for a detailed definition of the concept.</em></p> <p>Integrity is honouring your word.

his hut on Nan-yueh Mountain. Watching him one day, Huai-jang, his master, thought, “He will become a great monk,” and inquired:<br>
“Worthy one, what are you trying to attain by sitting?”<br>
Ma-tsu replied: “I am trying to become a Buddha.”<br>
Thereupon Huai-jang picked up a piece of roof tile and began grinding it on a rock in front of him.<br>
“What are you doing, Master?” asked Ma-tsu.<br>
“I am polishing it to make a mirror,” said Huai-jang.<br>

“How could sitting in zazen make a Buddha?” <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li> <li id="fn3" class="footnote-item"><p>The idea of multiple yous actually has growing evidence in neuroscience. See, for example McGilchrist’s the Master and his Emissary which provides a lot of evidence that your right and left hemisphere see the world differently and would operate differently. Similarly, Kahnemann and Tversky’s work can be framed in terms of 2 parallel decision making processes: a fast and a slow one. One way to explain self-control or inconsistent decision-making is to imagine at least two “yous” in decision making and maybe more e.g.  matrix of four between self control + impulsive and fast / slow (i.e. heuristic and reasoned). <a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li> <li id="fn4" class="footnote-item"><p>See “Mckinsey Kiss of Death” <a href="https://www.caseinterview.com/mckinsey-kiss-of-death:" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.caseinterview.com/mckinsey-kiss-of-death:<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <blockquote><p>“The McKinsey culture involves others giving you a lot of feedback on how to improve your performance.
