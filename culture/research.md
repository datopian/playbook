## Ideas

* Netflix: “Highly aligned -- loosely coupled”
* Common feature of the more high-tech is high / very competitive compensation
  * Netflix: we pay at the top of the range, we lose anyone who isn’t a star performer.
  * Valve: our compensation is very competitive.
* CLOU = Colleague Letter of Understanding. Every year, each Morning Star employee negotiates a Colleague Letter of Understanding (CLOU) with the associates who are most affected by his or her work. A CLOU (pronounced “clue”) is, in essence, an operating plan for fulfilling one’s mission. An employee may talk to 10 or more colleagues during the negotiations, with each discussion lasting 20 to 60 minutes. A CLOU can cover as many as 30 activity areas and spells out all the relevant performance metrics. All together, CLOUs delineate roughly 3,000 formal relationships among Morning Star’s full-time employees.

## Summary of Dalio

Values => Goals => Identify Problems (with achieving those) => Diagnose => Design (solutions) => Do the tasks in the plan

Values => Goals => Problems => Diagnoses => Designs => Tasks

* Values = what you consider important, what you value.
* Goals (?) = concrete outcomes associated with those values.
* Principles = "rules / patterns" for operating in life that help you pursue your values and goals; consistent ways of acting and thinking. "Principles connect your values to your actions; they are beacons that guide your actions, and help you successfully deal with the laws of reality. It is to your principles that you turn when you face hard choices." p.7
