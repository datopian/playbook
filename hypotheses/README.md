# Hypotheses

The hypotheses principle states that when you have a question you should try and generate your own solution hypotheses *before* seeking help or answers from someone else.

Why are hypotheses important when you have questions?

They help to provide:

- Autonomy: The ability to function on your own.
- Capability: Having the necessary tools to be autonomous.
- Empowerment: Feeling confident that you are capable and able to be autonomous

Examples of this are:

- When you're wrong about a hypothesis, you can learn where you made a mistake, or how to improve next time. You learn a lot more even when you're incorrect.
- It's good practice to come up with hypotheses when you're stuck, because you might come up with a working solution on your own.
- Writing out your hypotheses can help to clarify your thoughts.
    - Though questions can come from confusion, in clarifying your questions (even if only to yourself), it may lead to understanding the problem from a different perspective.
- They can enhance your analytical skill - being willing ask questions is a great tool, but learning how to form your own hypotheses without outside help is invaluable.
- When you ask questions without your own hypotheses, you remain stuck, and dependent on someone else.
- Coming up with hypotheses teaches you to break down problems into smaller, more manageable parts. This can also help you more easily understand where the gaps in your knowledge are.
