# Meetings

* For all meetings we should have a meeting doc. Usually if meetings are regular we have a single meeting doc for all those meetings (i.e "Admin meeting doc") and we then update by adding new date of the meeting.
* Please check out the [meeting template][] for a sense of the layout. You can copy this template for your own meetings.
* Structure is as follows:
  * Put the date (we often use the date as the heading for the meeting if we have a document with multiple meetings in it)
  * List who is present
  * Goals: a meeting **MUST** have an intention and **SHOULD** have a short list of measurable associated outputs. These are what you plan to achieve out of the meeting. Start the meeting by reviewing (or establishing) the goals.
  * Agenda: a meeting **SHOULD** have an agenda (a short list of items to cover)
  * Decisions & Actions (tasks that are assigned)
  * Notes
