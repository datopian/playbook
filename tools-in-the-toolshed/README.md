# Tools Tidied away in the Toolshed

At the end of each work session or at some other regular basis regularly “tidy away” documents, etc.

## What are our “tools” and “materials”? How does this apply to us?

We work with "information" so our tools are our laptops, our documents, etc.

* Documents: Google Docs, HackMD, etc.
* Your computer: no temp files lying around, no uncommitted files in Git repos.
* Meetings: at the end of every meeting.
  * All action points are moved to the relevant issue tracker, etc.
  * All reference material is moved to relevant document.
* Managing Personal Todos: Use Getting Things Done and process every day.
* Your browser: end of day all tabs are closed (use a tab manager like Toby if you need to).

We tackled our practical problems one by one, as we reached them. In each case we followed a pattern which began with a survey of the situation, continued with a discussion or series of discussions which led to a decision, often written down in memorandum, black on white. The decision was elaborated into a plan, also written out and often revised. Finally the plan was checked and coordinated with our ten year plan, adopted as a project and fitted into the work schedule.

Some of our readers will feel that such a life pattern is over-organized. They would not wish to plan their activities so completely. After having tried it out, day after day, and year after year, we know it is the way to get things done. Two people can accomplish much in a day or a month or a year if they have defined objectives, agreed plans, if they work on the program systematically and conscientiously, giving as much attention to details as to the overall plan.

Take an illustration from the handling and conditioning of tools. We had a place for each tool. Shovels, hoes, rakes and bars were in racks on the right as we entered the tool shed. There were as many holes in the racks as there were tools. No one ever had to hunt for a shovel or a hoe. If one was missing, a glance showed its absence and we searched until we located it. If we could not find it, we replaced it. Actually, with this system, we almost never lost a tool.

After each job which was completed in less than a working day, the tools went back into their places. At the end of each day's work we followed the same procedure. Consequently, tools which were not in place were in actual use and tools not in use were in place. We tried to follow this practice even though a tool was used on several jobs in the course of one working day. To further classify and locate tools, we painted a bright stripe of color on their handles. If left in the grass or on top of a job they were easy to see and identify.

Ordinarily, capital goods should last a lifetime. Our cement mixer, for instance, bought new in 1933 for $20 was still doing good work when we passed it on to Herbert Leader twenty years later. We cleaned it up after each job and oiled it and housed it over the winter. It was a hand mixer, and many a visitor told us how we could hook it up with a gas engine or an electric motor. We continued to operate it by hand, however, and the capital outlay of twenty dollars for the mixer (minus its considerable value in 1953) spread over twenty years, came to less than one dollar per year.

In some ways exposure to the weather is more disastrous for the metal on tools than for the wood. Wood also suffers, however. One summer we had a job that involved handling clay in a $35 rubber-tired contractor's wheelbarrow. At the end of each day's work we washed the barrow with a hose and put it under cover for the night. Although the wooden handles of the barrow had been painted, within a month they showed serious deterioration as a result of repeated wetting and drying. We countered with generous doses of old engine-oil and saved the day.

In our tool shed, at the right side of the shovel rack, hung two pieces of burlap sacking on nails. As each shovel came from a job it was wiped clean and dry with the burlap. In the winter each shovel got a coat of oil, applied in half a minute with a rejected paint brush. The shovels were never rusty, therefore clay and loam did not stick to them, nor did they require banging and scraping on the job. Clean tools do more work with less labor.

Axes were in a compartment next to the shovels. Each night after work, the axes went into their places. If they were dull, they were sharpened. There is more difference on a job between a dull axe and a sharp axe than there is between night and day.
