Documentation of techniques and processes for **selecting** and **managing** projects especially using agile, iterative methods.

**NOTE: this is still a work in progress**

These processes can be used for both technical and non-technical projects.

* Agile Project Delivery
* User Stories
* Project Based Planning and Delivery - project selection and delivery at the business level (rather than project level). This approach fits with the Agile Project Delivery but is independent of it -- that is you can use Agile Project Delivery without adopting this and vice versa.
