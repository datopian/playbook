# Introduction and Overview

This is our team handbook. It is our guide to the systems, processes and patterns for getting things done.

We value judgment over rules. Patterns over processes, processes over systems. This means, for example, we put effort to explaining *why* we do things not just *how* we do things. 

We value parsimony and one way to do things. We prefer fewer systems and fewer things to know. We are happy to spend time refining and automating our processes and patterns.

In short, we value Zen - deep simplicity, nothing to add and nothing to take away. Essence, precision, elegance, rigour, frictionlessness.

## Our Principles

### 1. Integrity, Authenticity and Commitment to Something Bigger than Yourself

*An object has integrity when it is whole and complete. Any diminution in its wholeness and completeness results in a diminution in workability. Think of a wheel with missing spokes, it is not whole, complete. It will become out-of-round, work less well and eventually stop working entirely. Likewise, a system has integrity when it is whole and complete.*

**Required reading** - [A ‘Value-Free’ Approach To Values](  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4VpjxPkN_XcXzRmSU5HR2lMVm8/view)

#### Integrity

**Honouring your word** - Doing what you said you would do **or** whenever you will *not* be keeping your word you get in action restoring your word with everyone impacted. **Why is it important** - it is the bridge to workability and performance.


**Restoring integrity**
* You acknowledge the word you gave (your promise)
* You state matter of factly what happened (no justifications)
* You look at the impact on others and yourself of not keeping your word
* You say what you will put in place in future



| Steps | Example  | Example *(NOT working)* |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1. You **acknowledge** the word you gave (your promise)| *I said I would meet you for lunch at 1pm*  | Hi, hope I’m not late. | 
2. You state matter of factly what happened (no justifications) | *I arrived at 1:27pm* | *You would not believe what happened with the trains, it was a nightmare.* | 
| 3. You look at the **impact** on **others** and **yourself** of not keeping your word | *I imagine you have been concerned whether I’m coming, and probably annoyed and frustrated about my lack of punctuality and being kept waiting around. For my part, I’m stressed and rushed and feeling guilty about not respecting your time.* | *Hope you haven’t been waiting long.* | 
| You say what you will **put in place** in future. *This must be something “external” to yourself.*  | *"I will set a calendar reminder 10m before my meetings”* rather than *“I will try harder to be on time”* (this is intrinsic and we assume you tried your best this time – we always come from a place of assuming you did your best)

### 2. Initiative 
Take initiative and responsibility. We are agile and we want everyone to take responsibility and initiative. Be bold, be responsible.

### 3. Communication
We commit to be in communication and to provide feedback so we can both improve. If an issue arises we will raise it promptly so it can be addressed. We do not gossip. 

## Agreements
A. We may need to learn some new tools together. We will take this into account. At our end, we may expect you to do some learning and practice on your own time.

B. We will have the opportunity to learn from each other's experience.

C. You commit to make yourself available for planning together online on video calls. You also will ensure you have a high quality internet connection so we can do video conferencing on Google Meet (meeting links are automatically created for each meeting).

D. If required, you will install a unix-based operating system such as Ubuntu (Mac OSX is already unix based). This can be dual-boot. You will need to be responsible for installation and maintenance in your spare time.


## Communications

Intention and context: *as a virtual organization we need to have efficient, reliable, cost-effective way to communicate and share material.*

### Transparent Communication Guide

#### What is Transparent Communication - how does it works?

Transparent communication is a way to share information across all team members of a company. It will be used across platform such as chat and emails.

Transparent communication goal is to help all team members to be fully informed and understand what is going on within the company. Benefits include:

* Better connection of team members, better communication and understanding of each other,
* Better understanding of company's processes and workflow,
* Increases responsiveness and productivity,
* Decreases failures, mistakes and oversights,
* Helps new team members learn and socialise faster and
* Builds comfortable and trustful working environment that spurs innovation and experimentation

#### Policy and practises

To keep things fully transparent across our team, we have put some practises in place that will ensure that:

* We are using groups (which are internal mail lists) for different aspects of our company.
* We are cc-ing and bcc-ing those groups when communicating via email
* We are using \*\*Inbox Filters\*\* ( e.g. a **@blackhole**  parallel Inbox, where you will receive the emails you might not have direct relevance for)

### Communication Tools

  sync((Synchronous))
  async((Asynchronous))
  sync --> video[Video]
  async --> chat[Chat - GChat]
  async --> email[Email]
</mermaid>

* **Chat** - We use [Google chat](https://chat.google.com/) 
*A networking platform online (or download the app) where we have different rooms for different projects/purposes.*
*(Based on the transparent policy, we require people to speak publicly in the related group and @ the people you want to talk instead of texting privately, unless it is a personal chat.)* 
* **Voice / Video calls:** Our default tool is Google Meet - video call links are automatically added to every meeting set up using our Google Apps calendar.
  
  *Face to face communication is a big deal for humans. Facial cues are very important. Always prefer video over voice for synchronous.*

* **Email** - we use Gmail
* **Documents** - GDrive for all internal documents, Hackmd can be used when working with partners.
 
## How we communicate

Google Chats is the main text channel we use to communicate with our team members.

Any project information or artifacts (e.g. README or technical specs) should be kept on the drive and not on Google Chats. **We use Google Chats as a communication platform and not a knowledge management platform.** 

Once you have your Google Chats accounts, please let your Onboarder know and they will add you to the appropriate channels for your role and introduce you to everyone. 

Please say Hello too!

Refer to the [How we communicate](https://handbook.datopian.com/guide/#communications) section in team handbook.

## Communicating with clients

All client emails should bcc crm@datopian.com. 

Our clients can write to Viderum via support@datopian.com (for technical support related matters) and info@datopian.com (for general enquires).

## Team 

### Core Hours

Our general working hours are 9am UK - 6PM CET/ CEST. Not necessarily when you work, but when it is permissible to schedule meetings. Some team members will have different working hours as agreed in their contract.

### Phone book 

A place where phone numbers, usernames, phone numbers etc can be found: 

[Datopian Team Phonebook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hFw3jFHq_TF4m_Z76n0uzBz85UB9Yht4P2IZAPicBOI/edit#gid=129072431)

### Team Calendar

You have been given access to create, edit and share in [Datopian Team calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=dmlkZXJ1bS5jb21fbzhlbWhqMmJvZmptamF1YTE0cDYzbmlkbzBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ). We use the team calendar to track people's holidays and business trips. 

You can also add the calendars of the teammates you're mostly working with so you can easily see their availability:

* Go to your calendar and find the **"Add calendar"** section on the left sidebar
* Enter the email of the person you'd like to add

* Google Calendar automaticaly creates a Google Hangout Meets link.

### Holidays

Taking time off to recharge and spend time with loved ones is encouraged. We ask that you be mindful of business priorities when choosing which days to take off and liaise with you scrum master / product owner. 

To notify us of a holiday:

* Talk to your Scrum Master / Product Owner 
* Once agreed then write an email to office@datopian.com and inform them about the dates and the length of your absence.
* Make sure to add your holiday dates in our [Datopian Team calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=dmlkZXJ1bS5jb21fbzhlbWhqMmJvZmptamF1YTE0cDYzbmlkbzBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) as well as in your own private caledar.

### Sick leave policy

If you’re not feeling well and you’re unable to perform your duties, notify your Scrum Master / Product Owner as soon as possible. The notified person will then let teammates know.

Please add an out of office and include an alternative contact. 

For german employees:
* Remember you need to obtain the sick leave note (Arbeitsunfähigkeitsbescheinigung)
* Please send the document to office@datopian.com within 3 working days

### Travel Arrangements

All business-related travel arrangements must be approved by a member of the Leadership team. 

* The first thing to do is to research for the flights and the accommodation you want to book according to the budget agreed with your project manager
* Send an email with the links to office@datopian.com 
* Remember to include all information needed for the booking:
    * preferences in terms of flights and accommodation (late check-ins, breakfast, window seats, pre-order cabs etc)
    * Full name, birth date, phone number; airline miles account number if they are using frequent flier programme
* The ops team will book the requested hotel & flight and forward the confirmations to you 
* Remember to store all receipts from the trip or else they can’t get reimbursed. [See **Expenses** section ](https://handbook.datopian.com/guide/#company-expenses)

### Time tracking

Our appraoch to time-tracking reflects our principles: Trust in our employees, transparency with clients and lean processes. 

All team members should complete [Time tracking entry sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SvXG-q_TLGkIiy8YTh2AewmyecG6Tw8xfjM-sXncvK0/edit#gid=0) by the end of the week every week providing their hours aggregated on a weekly basis.

Some projects require more granular reporting. Your Scrum Master will advise what if there are additional requirements for a particular project 

## Finances

### Getting Paid


#### Team invoicing on Xero
        
We have updated our process to make it as smooth and easy and possible. Please find all the info you need [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wH59j0QsRAGtEa1yNpyqVYKe7Iq1WtUu5vDGv4SQo_M/edit#).

A step by step process & FAQs is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-KOd7g1HkUgyi2zLJ0AKs6h2_lszsQkd/edit#slide=id.p5). 

### Company Expenses policy

If you have any company expenses to be reimbursed for:

1. Use the **Expense claims** feature in Xero to upload your expenses/receipts
* Another option would be to download the Xero Accounting Application on their phone
    * [For Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xero.touch&hl=en)
    * [For iOS](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/xero-accounting-invoices/id441880705)

> NOTE: You must submit your expenses from the business trip as soon as possible; ideally, within 10 working days after the trip. 
Expenses submitted later than 5 months will not be paid. The same rule applies to non-travel expenses.

#### Team member Expense claim instructions:

* Log in with your account
* Click on ‘Business’
* Scroll down to ‘Expense claims’ and click on the button.
* Fill out ‘New Expense’: 
    * Purchase amount  - Amount on the receipt
    * Description - Short description of the expense type
    * Spent at - Where did you spend it? Could be a particular institution/restaurant/station etc.
    * Spent on - Date on the receipt
    * Account - Could be
        * 6411 -  Travel expenses

2. Make sure to submit your expenses for approval (or else they won’t be visible for any other person but yourself)
3. Send an email to office@datopian.com confirming that the expenses have been submitted

### German employees

#### Submitting expenses

* Submit your expenses to Datopian GmbH by following the procedure above. 
* After every business trip, you must also fill out and submit the [Per diem expense form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17bcyifuPuegLSgWNdgdEhIcmoNu2iedy/view) (more info below) along with the other travel expenses
    * The best way to do that is to download the form on your computer in order to have it calculated automatically (once you enter the rates)
    * Make sure to tick the breakfast / lunch / dinner boxes if they were included in the accomodation 

#### Travel policy

1. Fill out the [Per diem form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17bcyifuPuegLSgWNdgdEhIcmoNu2iedy/view) according to the [International per diem rates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17SAisgQp3BWzHOkNu54BmgUYVOUs9tnH/view) as follows:
* Anlass: Name of the event
* Land/Ort: City/Country
* Tagessatz: This is the per diem rate defined for the country you will be in. You can check these rates [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17SAisgQp3BWzHOkNu54BmgUYVOUs9tnH/view) (page 4).
    * The day of arrival and departure is always counted as half-day (the number in the second/middle column)
    * Eg. If you were in Gambia, you would get
        * 30 EUR for a full day (24 hrs) (if no meals are included in your accommodation) 
        * 20 EUR for a half day (more than 8 hours, less than 24)
 
2. Upload the Per diem form in Xero along with the rest of your trip expenses (as described above).
3. Make sure to mark them all and submit them for approval
4. Send an email to office@datopian.com confirming that your expenses have been submitted


### Finance / Office Team ONLY

See [Accounting & Finances Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSLj081NKkWPkR0Ys3ZVTy0tkFEr3pcJ-W86ajhchbg/edit#heading=h.qy0fklx1v9sk)

## Planning and the Sprint Cycle

See [Agile Delivery][agile] and [User Stories][us].

[agile]: /agile/
[us]: /user-stories/

TODO: merge / delete below in favour of agile delivery

### Sprint Planning

For new sprint, Product Owner:

* Ensure a milestone for the next sprint and the one after that[^why]
* Created issues on GitHub, in proper repos and correctly labelled **with**
  * Set of tasks in a checklist format
  * Section with "Acceptance criteria" checklist
* All issues are moved to 'This Sprint' column
* Written a proposed "sprint goal" - 1-3 sentences summarizing what we want to achieve

[^why]: At any given time we want milestones to exist for current sprint and one after it. Why? So that anything urgent or important [TODO: needs updating]


### Every Sprint Cycle

* Complete the [metrics][]

[metrics]: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15pAupQDACTd8xK0rbW616u_t8h7b3JR5MBO4otFMrIg/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=107379996189258597736

### Sprint Reviews

#### Before review starts

Each "scrum master" (with their team) has

* Reviewed the board and issues, moving everything that is done to done etc and adding a final note that is understandable about the state of the task
* Written a short summary in the planning doc about the sprint - what happened, was the sprint goal achieved, any learnings.

#### After review is complete with Product Owner

TODO: this is out of date. (This was Atomatic process)

* Summarized total time spent against estimated and noted any planned tasks that were incomplete and added this time to the [metrics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15pAupQDACTd8xK0rbW616u_t8h7b3JR5MBO4otFMrIg/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=107379996189258597736) tracker in 'Status Centre' Google sheet:
  * **Tab - Sprint metrics:** Extracted the points from your board and inserted 'Planned Points' (beginning of sprint), 'Planned Points - End of sprint' and 'Hours'.
  * **Tab - Timesheet:** The hours and points per project. 
* Keep all remaining open issues either in 'This Sprint' column (if work is to continue) or move to 'Next Sprint'/'Inbox' (this may happen as part of sprint planning)
* Closed all relevant milestones

Scrum-master:

* Check everyone has neither too much nor too little scheduled in next sprint

## Issues / Tasks

Some of this material is covered / duplicated in this OKI coding standards proposal https://github.com/okfn/coding-standards/issues/17

### Creating Issues

This key information should be present:

* Short description: of what is involved. A user story if possible
* Acceptance criteria: what would it mean for this to be done
* Tasks/Checklist: A list of tasks involved in doing this task. If you don't know a first task should be "Analyze this and get set of tasks"

```
Short description of bug or feature need preferentially in a user story form. 

[Can have multiple items esp if an epic]

## Acceptance Criteria (for epics or "big" issues)

* [ ] ...
* [ ] ...

## Tasks

*Task list*

* [ ] ...
* [ ] ...

## Analysis

*This section is optional. It is where you provide further analysis of the problem and analyze potential solutions, ending with a recommendation and tasks (the tasks are usually moved out into the tasks section above)*
```

All issues must be properly labelled:
- Support issues must have a support label (indicating their support package)
- All client related issues must have a client label (all colored #800080)
- Issues related to other, internal, projects need to be labelled accordingly
- Contextual labels are encouraged:
  - 'Source' labels for support issues (e.g. client/sentry/uptime etc.)
  - 'Technical Debt', 'Bug' etc. 

Make sure you record relationships between issues, e.g.
- Individual issues and their epics
- Support requests and their fixes

:::tip
Use keywords such as 'parent of #...', 'child of #...', 'depends on #...' in the issue description to automatically create these relationships.
:::

::: tip
On Github (and Gitlab) you can create an issue template so this structure is always present.
:::

#### Issue Naming

* Put [epic] prefix in title for epic issues
* (Optional) Grouping ... e.g. `[ux]` for ux issues

### Estimating

**Github:** Using Waffle you can add estimates. These should be in hours. Epics: your estimate for an epic should only be for time on subtasks **not** included in subissues.

**Gitlab:** Estimation support is built in.


### Closing Issues

When closing issues you should leave a comment like this so that readers (including you later) are clear at glance what the outcome was and why, including being able to locate quickly any outputs produced as part of resolving the issue.

```
FIXED | INVALID | WONTFIX | DUPLICATE. *Insert
your comment about what resolved this with links or issue references.*
```

Example:

```
FIXED. See commit {link to commit} and staging  {link to page on staging that was changed}.
```

```
WONTFIX. This is not worth doing as the benefit is minor and a lot of work to implement e.g. we have to change the whole way we do search.
```

Notes:

* When issues are closed in a commit you do not need to add a separate comment.
* If `INVALID, WONTFIX, DUPLICATE` also assign the relevant label. Why? Labels show up listing and comments don't. Conversely label is not obvious when reading the issue comment thread

::: tip
Use the 'Fixes #...' keyword in your commit messages (or pull request descriptions) to automatically close issues when a PR is merged.

You can refer to issues in another repo by using the full notation, e.g. 'fixes DatopianGlobal/PM#10'
:::

### Commit messages' format

```
[ex][m]: plotly json examples - fixes #23.
```

That is:

* a tag: [ex] this is an example - you make these tags up and use them consistently.
* a size: [m] a size of this commit one of xs s m l xl
* a short descriptive sentence of what you did. I need this as well as what issue this refs as I need to be able to understand the commit on its own without reading something else.
* Finally anything that involves referencing or closing a github issue. e.g. refs #xx or fixes #xx (fixes and closes are synonymous so use either one)

So command would look like this:

```
git commit -m '[ex][m]: plotly json examples - fixes #23'
```

## Standups

Standups are a means to keep everyone updated with what you're up to.

Purpose:

* keep team in sync
* surface blockers
* deal with issues arising (e.g. need to reprioritize in face of an arising issue or change in estimate)

Each person needs to write

* What is my plan for today?
* What did accomplish yesterday?
* Do I have any blockers? 
* What is my availability for today?

We write these standups on the #standup channel on chat, whenever we start our working day.

## Meetings

* For all meetings we should have a meeting doc. Usually if meetings are regular we have a single meeting doc for all those meetings (i.e "Admin meeting doc") and we then update by adding new date of the meeting. 
* Please use the [meeting template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HIzMGA8_UV3bQL_uMgdvjY8P_fD3nw3-SWFHiu4_NZc/edit#heading=h.g8hq0h2xwr6b) so that our meeting documents are clear and consistent. You should COPY the template instead of editing it directly.
* Structure is as follows:
  * List date (we often use the date as the heading for the meeting if we have a document with multiple meetings in it)
  * List who is present
  * Goals: a meeting **MUST** have a short list of goals for that meeting. These are what you plan to achieve out of the meeting. Start the meeting by reviewing (or establishing) the goals.
  * Agenda: `a meeting **SHOULD** have an agenda (a short list of items to cover)
  * Decisions & Actions (tasks that are assigned)
  * Notes 

Here's an example layout in markdown

```
### 16 Jan 2017

Present: X, Y, Z

Goals:
* Plan the next week of work
* Pick a date for our team meeting

Agenda:
* Planning
  * List the main projects for the next week of work
  * List key tasks for each project
  * Prioritize each project
  * Check time allocated against availability
* Date of next meeting

Actions:
* Agreed on next meeting to be held in 2 weeks, James to schedule
```

## User Stories and Analysis

User stories are a great way of gathering requirements in an agile environment, where one of the key values is responding to change over following a plan. They are a good anchor for conversation that can then take place at the right time.

A user story is a short sentence that encapsulates three things:

* Who?
* What?
* Why?

**User story template:** 
*As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.*

SEE: https://github.com/rufuspollock/project-management/blob/master/user-stories.md

## Appendix

### Markdown

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as **bold** or *italic*, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like ## or *.
