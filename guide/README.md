# Introduction 

We are Datopian. We work with organizations of all sizes to design, develop and scale solutions to manage their data and unleash its potential.

We have worked with dozens of teams all over the world, from small startups to large multi-national organizations. We have also created our own products and dozens of open source libraries. You can read more about what we do and how we do it on our website at https://datopian.com/ -- have a quick look around ðŸ”­

This is our playbook. It is our guide to the systems, processes and patterns for getting things done. It's filled with things we've learned based on our own experience and study of others' experiences.

It is a living document that everyone at Datopian can edit in a public git repo.

We've made the playbook open so you can study and use it -- and just as we studied and built on the work of others.
