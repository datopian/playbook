# Mentor Guide

Congratulations and thank-you for being a mentor! It's a special privilege to get to mentor an apprentice in the last stage of their journey to full Datopianhood.

This guide outlines your responsibilities as a mentor and also include guidance and tips on how to be a great mentor.

## Context

Mentorship is the third and last phase of the [Apprentice Program][appr].

[appr]: /apprentice/

## Intention of Mentorship

The intention of the mentorship is to develop and evaluate the apprentice with the goal that they successfully become a fully operational datopian (at a junior level) within a reasonable time frame (e.g. ~1-2m). Specifically, the mentorship should:

* Introduce them to client work
* Discover their skills gap (and help fill it)
* Have them starting to contribute productively

## What does it involve?

This should not interrupt or disturb your current work that much. The one specific additional commitment is the one-to-one meeting with your apprentice that should be no more than 1h per week.

In terms of structure

* The apprentice works with you each day.
  * Depending on the amount of time overlap this will likely be anything from 4-8h (minimum should be 4h)
  * We suggest quite a bit of pair programming though you can structure this however you wish 
* Should follow your existing work -- no expectation you specifically train them
  * If you find skills gap just task them to go off and self-learn or talk to apprentice program coach. That is, it is not your job to sort that out or train them in skills ...
* One on one meeting: Every friday you have a 1-on-1 meeting with them


## The first day with your new Apprentice

On your first day with your new apprentice we recommend having a meeting and covering:

* Introductions: briefly introduce yourself and ask them about themselves
* Where they are: Where they see themselves currently in terms of strengths and weaknesses
* What they'll be doing: Brief them on what you are working on and give them a rough sense of the plan for the month e.g. in "week 1 we will focus on X".

If you can, set explicit goals e.g. "At the end of week one you will be able to install CKAN".

This meeting is also a good opportunity to tell them about the client project you’ll be working on together.

### Resourcing of the Apprentice

You want to assign your mentees to client projects as fast as possible so that they gain more experience and are all set to become fully operational Datopians. Please make sure to follow the process for [Resourcing of Apprentices ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dB9lKeh1Kg4mQE0SPKCzuDYSGW1iEulmpNL6dFg2W6M/edit#heading=h.l2pn4hdriw1s).


## One-on-One Retrospective

Once a week you should meet with your Apprentice and have retrospective (you can do this any day but we recommend Friday). Each apprentice meets with their mentor at a time that works for both of them.

During the one-on-one:

* Review with your apprentice what was worked on this week and their thoughts, feelings, and concerns.
* Review their goals and the rough plan for the week and make any adjustments necessary.
* Review the upcoming week and what the plan is.
* Briefly recap the plan for the remaining time with you and make adjustments as necessary.


## Being an Effective Mentor

### Structural things you can do to be an effective Mentor

* **Hold yourself accountable for the weekly Friday meetings**. This is a critical opportunity for Apprentices to receive feedback and make each week better than the last.
* **Pair as much as possible.** Put it on your calendar. Aim to pair 50% of the time (or more). Even if you feel like you are working on something new, it is an invaluable lesson for an Apprentice to see how you approach new problems.
* **Client work or breakable toy?** Breakable toys provide a good sandbox for Apprentices to play around, but client work teaches important lessons about project flow, git, and working on a team. It also provides more opportunities for pairing with you. What Apprentices work on is ultimately up to them, but encourage a mixture of client work and breakable toy time.
* **Include Apprentices in all aspects of consulting.** Invite them to client meetings and sales meetings. These interactions are an important part of what we do.

### Soft skills to remember as a Mentor

* **Understand the Apprentice's situation.** Being the most junior person in the room is never easy. And, in many ways, being an Apprentice is like conducting a 3-month long interview. Simply being aware of these facts will help you develop empathy for the Apprentice.
* **Assume that nothing is 'obvious' or 'easy.'** When you've been doing this whole 'development/design' thing for a while, certain concepts are taken for granted.  Apprentices enter the program at all different levels. Teaching the basics is a great opportunity to brush up on them yourself!
* **Exposing vulnerability is powerful.** Apprentices run into something new every five minutes. The wonderful thing about being an Apprentice is that you can ask your mentor questions. But asking questions can be scary. If you, as a mentor, are open about things that you don't know, Apprentices will feel more comfortable asking 'dumb' questions.
* **Give regular feedback, both positive and negative.** The weekly Mentor-Apprentice meeting is important for giving high-level feedback, but don't forget to give Apprentices regular feedback on the awesome and less awesome things that they do throughout the day. Three months is a short amount of time, but small feedback loops help Apprentices level up as quickly as possible.

### From Techstars' Mentor Manifesto and other sources

* Be authentic. Mentoring is a human interaction.
* Be challenging, but never destructive.
* Be direct. Tell the truth, however hard.
* Be optimistic.
* Be responsive.
* Clearly commit to mentoring, or do not be a mentor.
* Clearly separate opinion from fact.
* Clearly state what is an interruption for you and what isn’t.
* Communicate with other mentors.
* Determine what motivates the apprentice. Ask, "Why are you doing what you’re doing?"
* Don’t write their code for them. Provide examples and references to documentation.
* Expect nothing in return (you’ll be delighted with what you do get back).
* Focus. Avoid adding new goals. Help the apprentice achieve or re-order existing goals.
* Force the apprentice to drive the relationship. They set goals, you help them reach them.
* Guide, don’t control. Apprentices must make their own decisions. It’s their personal development, not yours.
* Have empathy. Remember that learning is hard.
* Know what you don’t know. Say, "I don’t know" when you don’t know.
* Learn something. Mentoring is not one-way. The more you’re in a learning mindset, you’ll connect easier with each other and you’ll avoid complacency.
* Listen. Ask questions. Listen again.
* Practice what you preach.
* Provide specific actionable advice.
* Read the [Dreyfus model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) of skill acquisition. Agree with your apprentice what stage they’re in for each skill they’re trying to acquire (Python, Javascript, SQL, interaction design, etc.). Help them move to the next stage.
* Reflect on the quality of the apprentice’s work in their presence.
* Reflect on the quality of your work in your apprentice’s presence.
* Reframe if your experience tells you it will help the apprentice.
* Treat every situation as new. Consider the current context.
* Use your network to find your apprentice interesting work after the program.
* Be Socratic. Ask tons of questions.

## Improve the Mentorship 

Feedback is always appreciated at Datopian. 

* Fill out and submit the [Evaluation form for Mentors](https://forms.gle/5f5sfPXL7cLUQiA66) at the end of each week and give feedback about your mentoree.
* Any ideas for improvements of the Mentorship program are more than welcome.
