# Tech Leaders Program

Datopian is doing work for many clients and demand is consistent and growing. We have a suite of our own tools, products and patterns.

To meet that demand we need people who are able to analyse and specify technical work in a way that meets client needs as well as developing our own tooling and approaches to data management problems.

These are the **Datopian Tech Leaders**. Through a rigorous development program you will be able to consistently and powerfully design technical solutions to the data management problems we encounter, with a common approach to problem analysis and shared design principles.

**Pre-alpha**: The Tech Leaders is in its infancy and we are still working a lot of things out. Expect things to evolve.
