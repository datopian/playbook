It is especially useful for strategy and is part of the standard training in leading strategy consultancies such as McKinsey.</p> <p>It can be used in a number of ways, from telling stories to structuring research programmes to planning projects.</p> <p>It is sometimes written as SCQA, for <em>Answer</em>, but it is usually helpful to treat the last component as a <em>Hypothesis</em>, which can then be tested.</p> <p>It describes a problem (situation, complication), frames a question about what to do, and finally offers a solution in the form of the hypothesis.</p> <p>The hypothesis is optional. In some cases, you will only have a question at the start of your work and a hypothesis will only come later (once you’ve done work on your question).</p> <p>An SCQH does two things: provides clarity on the problem (and solution) and aligns the group on that. This second factor is often as important as the first.</p> <p>An SCQH is best created in a small group of people, say maximum 7-8 (but you can do more). Once you have the SCQH you can share with wider and wider groups as needed.</p> <p>Allow between 2h and several days to create an SCQH depending the scale of the issue and the size of the group.

This should be a mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (MECE) logic tree from left to right, outlining all the questions you need to answer for your question to be answered.</p> <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bmjxHbv.png" alt="Imgur"></p> <p>Issue trees are a great way of working out what is causing a certain problem. They are the starting point for solving a problem, since you can’t solve a problem if you don’t know what the problem actually is!</p> <p>The theory behind creating issue trees is that they give you a scaffold or framework within which to brainstorm. To explain why this is important, consider the following example: someone gives you 30 seconds to make up a story in your head. This is actually quite difficult, since the possibilities are endless. It would be much easier if they framed your story for you - for example, they tell you it must be a story about a dog that travels to Paris by himself, and involves a baguette, a policeman and the Eiffel Tower.</p> <p>Issue trees work in much the same way. Once you have a basic framework down on paper, fleshing out the rest becomes much easier. The hardest part of the issue tree is creating this framework.</p> <p>Let’s consider an example. We want to create an issue tree to answer the following question: “why did our leather goods company make less money in 2020 compared to 2019?”. This question goes in a box on the left hand side of our page and forms the ‘tree trunk’. Note that the question itself is quite specific - it doesn’t just ask ‘why is our company making less money’, but adds some detail about the company and the specific time period in which less money was earned.</p> <p>We then have to add on two (or possibly three) branches that split our question into the main areas in which the problem could be found. These branches should be MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive). Mutually exclusive in the sense that the branches are completely distinct and do not overlap in any way. Collectively exhaustive in the sense that all possible causes of our problem that exist come under the umbrella of one branch. See the ‘5 Ways to be MECE guide’ below for a full summary.</p> <p>Let’s look at the example below:</p> <figure><img src="/assets/img/issue-tree-branches-1.f8e451d6.jpg" alt="issue tree 1" height="300"></figure> <p>In this example, ‘factors within our control’ and ‘factors outside of our control’ are completely distinct from each other. Moreover, there is no cause of our problem that is not covered by these two ‘umbrella’ branches. Making sure that these two branches are MECE is the most important part of the process because it ensures that no possible causes of our problem can slip through the cracks even before the real brainstorming begins.</p> <p>We now need to add another layer of branches, and these also need to be MECE.</p> <figure><img src="/assets/img/issue-tree-branches-2.361072d2.jpg" alt="issue tree 2" height="300"></figure> <p>We now have a solid framework down on paper in which all possible areas in which the cause of our problem could be found are laid out. It’s time to start fleshing out ideas. Your finished issue tree might look like this:</p> <iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://embed.coggle.it/diagram/XuN_XCaim1QmKLxT/72e1a13601d0cabfb88cead326d453ff7ab13f9288b7699d521ecc9809aca4dd" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> <p>Many people find it difficult to know where to stop iterating branches. The best way to know whether to stop is to work out whether you can now discredit any of the options based on facts or statistics. For example, in the branch on economic factors, with a little market research you should be able to work out whether there’s a recession or market uncertainty. Likewise, possible causes such as a rise in veganism, whether there are more competitors on the market or if people are shopping less are all factors that can be either confirmed or discredited with statistics.<br>
Sometimes, you might need to gather these statistics yourself. For example, to find out whether your staff are demotivated, you might carry out a survey of attitudes.</p> <p>A great thing about issue trees is that you can also guess which possible causes are very unlikely before you start to gather information or statistics. For example, if there was a technical problem with your website or your staff were being rude to customers, you would probably have received lots of complaints by now. Going through your issue tree and writing down ‘likely’ or ‘unlikely’ next to each possible cause can help you prioritise which areas to look into first.</p> <p>In this sense, issue trees have most impact when used early on in the problem solving process, when you know little about the problem. Since issue trees disaggregate problems into smaller pieces, they also make it easier to divide the work needed to get to the bottom of an issue between teams.</p> <p>Some branches on the above issue tree could be looked into in more detail. For example, if you think it likely that the problem lies with your company finances, and suspect you are overspending, you might want to expand these branches.

Prioritise according to insightfulness and efficiency.<br>
a. Insight: showing fundamental characteristics of the problem.<br>
b. Efficiency: prioritise or eliminate parts of your structure with little bits of data<br>
c. If in doubt, pick another framework and compare the differences.</li> <li>Build the rest of the tree by breaking down each bucket of the first layer.</li> <li>Evaluate your structure.<br>
a. Best is to ask a consultant.<br>
b. Second best is to practice with cases for which you have good answers<br>
c. Third is to assess against the principles of a good structure</li></ol> <figure><img src="/assets/img/mece-18.95829c77.png" alt="mece 17"></figure> <p>And remember:</p> <ul><li>Did I pick the technique that will bring me the most insight to do the first break-down? The first layer of your structure is critical because it determines the rest.</li> <li>Am I missing anything? One way to test this is to google the topic of the case (in this case “warehouse theft”), read a couple of articles or news about it, list down the issues/ideas/hypotheses that come up in those articles and see if there’s a place for each in your structure. If there’s not, it’s probably not MECE.</li> <li>Try explaining your structure to someone else (a friend, your romantic partner or even your dog will do!) and see if you sound like a human being going through your structure. If you don’t, it’s probably too complex or too “buzzwordy”.</li></ul></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/datopian/playbook/edit/master/scqh/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edit this page</a> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></div> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
