# SCQH: Situation, Complication, Question Hypothesis

SCQH is a simple and powerful problem solving tool. It is especially useful for strategy and is part of the standard training in leading strategy consultancies such as Mckinsey.

It can be used in a number of ways, from telling stories to structuring research programmes to planning projects.

It is sometimes written as SCQA, for Answer, but it is usually helpful to treat the last component as  a Hypothesis, which can then be tested.

It describes a problem (situation, complication) frames a question about what to do, and finally offers a solution in the form of the hypothesis.

The hypothesis is optional. In some cases, you will only have a question at the start of your work and a hypothesis will only come later (once youâ€™ve done work on your question)
