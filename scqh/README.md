# SCQH: Situation, Complication, Question Hypothesis

## Introduction

Situation, Complication, Question, Hypothesis (SCQH) is a simple and powerful problem-solving tool. It is especially useful for strategy and is part of the standard training in leading strategy consultancies such as McKinsey.

It can be used in a number of ways, from telling stories to structuring research programmes to planning projects.

It is sometimes written as SCQA, for *Answer*, but it is usually helpful to treat the last component as a *Hypothesis*, which can then be tested.

It describes a problem (situation, complication), frames a question about what to do, and finally offers a solution in the form of the hypothesis.

The hypothesis is optional. In some cases, you will only have a question at the start of your work and a hypothesis will only come later (once you’ve done work on your question).

### What is SCQH?

* SCQH is a problem solving tool.
* It can be used in a number of ways, from telling stories to structuring research programmes to planning projects.
* SCQH stands for Situation, Complication, Question and Hypothesis.
  * It is sometimes written as SCQA, for Answer, but it is usually helpful to treat the last component as  a Hypothesis, which can then be tested.
* It describes a problem (situation, complication) frames a question about what to do, and finally offers a solution in the form of the hypothesis

## Structure of an SCQH

### Overview

Each SCQH item gets one sentence. This makes you keep things simple and distill the problem down to its essence.
* Situation: where are we now, what’s the context.
* Complication: what’s the problem, what’s not working.
* Question: what do we need to work out, what can we do?
* Hypothesis: what we propose to do to solve the question.

### Situation

_“For a long time we have been…”_

Start by telling your audience something they already know. This helps establishes relevance. As soon as they are asking themselves “I know this – why are you telling me?” you have them hooked. You now have an opening for the Complication.

Typical situations are “we have a task to perform”, “we have a problem” and “we took an action”.

_Situations should be factual. They aren’t about what’s wrong. “The walls of our apartment are white,” is a situation, whereas, “I don’t like the white walls of our apartment,” is not._

**Example situation:** we’re a company making baths and we’ve been losing money ($100k per year) the last two years. 

### Complication

_“Recently the situation has changed…”_

What happened next? And specifically, what’s the problem with the situation. The Complication creates tension in the story you’re telling. This triggers the Question you will ask.

Typical complications: “something is stopping us performing the task”, “we [don’t] know the solution to the problem”, “a solution to the problem has been suggested” and “the action we took didn’t work”.

**Example complication:** if we keep losing money at this rate we’ll be bankrupt in 2 years time and we don’t have any new products ready that will change the situation. Often at the start you won’t be clear what is situation and what is complication. That’s fine, just put whatever comes up down

### Question

_“So what should we do?”_

The Question arises logically from the Complication and leads into the Answer.

Typical questions: “what should we do?”, “how do we implement the solution?”, “is it the right solution?” and “why didn’t the action work?”

**Example question:** what new product can we develop and market in the next two years that will generate at least $1m in revenues and at least $100k in profit per year? 

### Hypothesis

_“We need to…”_

The Answer to the Question is the substance of your main point. Summarise it first – completing your introduction – then break it down into details and write the main body of your presentations.’

_NB: The answer is better thought of as a hypothesis in research-based scenarios._

**Example hypothesis:** we will develop and launch within the next 18 months a new enamel bath targeted at the high-end market

### Process for Doing an SCQH

* An SCQH does two things: provides clarity on the problem (and solution) and aligns the group on that.
  * The SCQH is an important group alignment process.
* Situation should be “facts” as much as possible. Complication is where opinion comes in.
* An SCQH is best created in a small group of people, say maximum 7-8 (but you can do more) and then shared outwards.
* Allow at least 2h to create an SCQH.
  * It will be faster the smaller the group and the more experience people have with the process.


## Examples

### Example 1: Butcher

**Situation:** we’re a small family butchers in a medium-sized UK market town and we've lost so many customers (and with them, revenue) over the past few years that we've been considering bankruptcy for a while.

**Complication:** a major supermarket chain has just announced it is going to build a new store (complete with a butchers counter) on the outskirts of town.

**Question:** how can we make as much profit as possible with the stock we have left before jumping ship?

**Hypothesis:** we will sell our 150-year old sausage recipe (our bestseller) to a new local farm shop and organise local press coverage, in which we will also mention that our last stock items will be selling at a discount on Saturday.

### Example 2: iMed

This is a real-life SCQH for [iMed](https://imedproject.org/).

**Situation:** Medicines are expensive to research and cheap to make and millions of people need them; meanwhile funding mechanisms are not directly linked to health impact, profits are based on prices, and the existence of monopoly patents supports prices well above the cost of manufacture.

**Complication:** Monopoly patents fund innovation through high prices, creating an inevitable tension between access and innovation; and currently denying access to medicines for millions of people through inflated prices and lack of innovation in non-profitable areas, and failing to incentivise for health impact or efficiency of research and manufacture.

**Question:** What funding mechanisms can replace the tension between innovation and access inherent in the current [patent] system; incentivising innovation based on cost effective health impact, providing incentives for innovation as high as today, and providing access at close to the cost of manufacture.

**Hypothesis:** The best resolution to the tension between access and innovation is a remuneration rights model that removes the dilemma and offers incentives for both innovation and access; it provides a free market, state-independent mechanism resourced by the state and philanthropists that incentivises innovations via remuneration based on health impact, on condition that the innovations are free to use and unrestricted, allowing for competition in manufacturing and therefore lower prices for medicines whilst providing incentives for innovators at a similar level to today.


## Issue Trees and Hypothesis 

The SCQH alone is very powerful. But you can take the SCQH a step further and turn it into a complete planning and implementation tool using  an issue tree and hypothesis trees.

**Issue tree:** expands the question into a series of sub-questions
**Hypothesis tree:** expands the solution statement into a series of sub-statements

### Issue Tree

The Question can be broken down into an Issue Tree. This should be a mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (MECE) logic tree from left to right, outlining all the questions you need to answer for your question to be answered.

### Hypothesis Tree

In a similar fashion, the Hypothesis can be broken down into a Hypothesis tree. This should be a MECE logic tree from top to bottom, outlining all the hypotheses you need to prove for your hypothesis to be accepted or rejected.

## Issue Tree Template Spreadsheet

We have created a [Google Sheets SCQH Issue Tree Template][issue-tree-tmpl].

[issue-tree-tmpl]: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oqtKoSW11eRw6HJ5RtDkJTKIyUskNqqlJ7ca9SPvvWE/edit?usp=sharing

What do the columns mean?

* **What material is needed?** A literal description of what the output should be (e.g. a list, a 1-pager, etc.) or, more broadly, a definition of "done" for this item. For example, if the question were "*Who are our competitors?*", the "*What material is needed*" might say "*A list of our competitors with brief description*".
* **Value**: An estimate of business value. We recommend 1-13 Fibonacci.
* **Status**: Completion status 0-100%.
* **Owner**: Who owns answering this.
* **By when**: When this will be completed by.
* **Output**: The output(s) answering this question. Usually a link to outputs e.g. others docs, spreadsheets, etc. If the answer is short, it can be written directly.
* **Notes / TODO**: Self-explanatory. This will often be used sparingly and detailed planning work on answering something will be in a separate project management system.

### Notes

* The sheet is set up for an issue tree of depth 3. If you have greater depth, just add more columns to the left of the green line.
