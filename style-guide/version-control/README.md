# Version Control

We use Git for all projects.

### Commit messages

```bash
[ex][m]: plotly json examples - fixes #23.
```

That is:

* a tag: [ex] this is an example - you make these tags up and use them consistently.
* a size: [m] a size of this commit one of xs s m l xl
* a short descriptive sentence of what you did. I need this as well as what issue this refs as I need to be able to understand the commit on its own without reading something else.
* Finally anything that involves referencing or closing a github issue. e.g. refs #xx or fixes #xx (fixes and closes are synonymous so use either one)

So command would look like this:

```bash
git commit -m '[ex][m]: plotly json examples - fixes #23.'
```

### Branch management

We generally follow [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), with some modifications, and some flexibility per project. The following should hold true for pretty much all projects:

* Have a `master` branch
* Never commit directly to `master`
* Always work from a `feature/{}` or a `fix/{}` branch that is checked out from `master`
* Always reference issues from Git messages using `#{issue_id}`, and the various other related conventions used by most Git hosts.
* Properly describe changes in commit messages: "Fixes database migration script failure on Python 2.7", not "Fix."
* Prefer to use the "Squash and merge" approach for pull requests using GitHub web interface
