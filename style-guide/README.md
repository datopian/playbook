## Datopian Style guide

Each significant open-source venture has their own style guide. It shows a lot about how the code is composed for that task. When all the code in an enormous codebase it will be more clear if it in reliable and consistent style.

A good example is camelCasing for variable names in JavaScript. Where a variable name will start with a capital letter in the second word. For example: marketingStrategy, newComputer, getContent, etc. Below you can find the styleguides here for [Markdown](https://gitlab.com/datopian/core/handbook/tree/master/style-guide/markdown), [JavaScript](https://gitlab.com/datopian/core/handbook/tree/master/style-guide/javascript)
 and [Python](https://gitlab.com/datopian/core/handbook/tree/master/style-guide/python). Please go over them to have a clear understanding.
