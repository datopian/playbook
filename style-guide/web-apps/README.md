# Web Apps

## URLs

* In general do not use trailing slash on urls (but ensure you redirect 301 from trailing slash to non-trailing slash) e.g.: /work not /work/, /work/9 not /work/9/

## RESTful APIs

* Use plural versions of entities names for endpoints
* When implementing RESTful APIs, keep them RESTful, but don't hesitate to create endpoints that are not RESTful when it is practical

## Browser support

We support modern browsers. Notably, IE 10 and above. Our browser support is in sync with the browser support of Google web properties, as [declared here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33864?hl=en)
