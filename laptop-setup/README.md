# Laptop Setup

Your laptop is your light saber. Don't go into battle without it.

:::tip
This section is largely for developers. However, even non-developers will benefit from having all or some of this done.
:::

We recommend you have a MacOS laptop if possible. Second best is Linux-based, e.g. Ubuntu, etc.

Please have the following software installed:

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) -- we recommend it as default editor if you don't already have one (e.g. Vim, Emacs, etc.). Even if you already have an editor we recommend installing it as we use it for remote pair programming.
* Package Manager e.g. on MacOS you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed and set up for development and on Windows you have [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) installed. You can then use the package manager to install other tools.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
* [Python (v3)](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Remote Pair Programming

We use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for remote pair programming and we recommend it as default editor if you donâ€™t already have one (e.g. Vim, Emacs, etc.).

For pair programming, we recommend using the ["Live Share" functionality][liveshare] (which is built in).
