# Laptop Setup

Your laptop is your light saber. Don't go into battle without it.

:::tip
This section is largely for developers. However, even non-developers will benefit from having all or some of this done.
:::

We recommend you have a MacOS laptop if possible. Second best is Linux-based e.g. Ubuntu etc.

Please have the following software installed:

* Google Chrome
* Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/ -- we recommend it as default editor if you don't already have one (e.g. vim, emacs etc). Even if you already have an editor 
we recommend installing this as we use this for remote pair programming.
* Package Manager e.g.  on MacOS you have Brew installed and set up for development (you can then use this to install other tools)
* Git
* Python (v3)
* NodeJS

## Remote Pair Programming

We use Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/ for remote pair programming and we recommend it as default editor if you donâ€™t already have one (e.g. vim, emacs etc).

For pair programming, we recommend using the ["Live Share" functionality][liveshare] (which is built in).
