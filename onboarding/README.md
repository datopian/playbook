# Onboarding Guide


## Intention

*The intention of this Onboarding Guide is to fulfil on the following user stories.*

As an Onboardee I want a simple step by step process to get set up (that I can do largely on my own) so that I am ready to go (and know i am ready to go)


## Onboardee

*We want your feedback as new joiners! Be critical, tell us what does not work, what isn’t obvious!*

1. **Login in to your email account** and read your onboarding email (if you haven't already)

2. **Read the [Handbook main guide][guide]. Note ALL questions that arise in a google doc

2. **Setup accounts on the systems we use**. See below.

3. Add contact details to [Team Phonebook][phonebook] 

4. Email the Onboarder that you have accounts set up and details in team phonebook. They will now go and add you to relevant systems ...

5. Wait until you get a response to let you know you are added to relevant systems

6. Read about your work processes for the job you do

5. Go through work “processes” in more detail; This depends on the accountability the Onboardee will assume;
E.g.

    * Work sprints
    * Trello management 
    * Practice on trello (acceptance criteria, checklist, closing issues…)
    * How to take meeting notes on operation meeting notes

7. Do the onboarding quiz

### Systems we use

Create an account on each of these. Please make sure you set up Gravatar first. For items marked with a `*` please add your account id to the phone book.

* Gravatar - https://gravatar.com. We set this up so that your profile picture will show up automatically on your profile on other systems. Add *all* the email(s) you will use on other accounts. For example, if you plan to sign up to Trello with your personal email rather than your organization email then also add that email address to your gravatar.
* Github - https://www.github.com 
* Gitlab - https://gitlab.com/
* Slack - https://slack.com/ (we recommend signing in with your github account as it helps in permissions management)
* Trello - https://trello.com/

### Setting up Google Drive

After setting up your email address, you will have access to G Suite, and of cours, your Google Drive.
The Oboarder will grant you access to Team Drives, so you can access the Information you need.
Any new documents / sheets /presentations you create should be created in the appropriate folder in the Team Drive, NOT YOUR DRIVE.
If you require access to files that you currently don't have access to, please reach out to your Onboarder or your Line Manager.

#### Style Guide

Set up google docs to use our default styles: [Handbook Style Guide section][styleguide]

[styleguide]: /guide/#style-guide

### How we communicate

We use Slack to communicate with our team members.

Slack is a business communication tool, where all the other team members keep in touch and update on a daily basis theyre work progress.

Your Oboarder will add you to the appropriate groups for your role and introduce you to everyone.

Please say Hello too !

Exercises

### Using the Calendar

You have been given access to create, edit and share in Datopian Team calendar.

We set up meetings with our colleagues through sending invitations, such that everyone is clear on the time of the meeting.

Additionally, Google Calendar automaticaly creates a Google Hangout Meets link for everyone partaining to that specific meeting to join.

You will also be added to a team calendar where you can see people's availability and you can update yours.

### Tracking time

TODO

### Submitting your invoices and getting paid

* Set up an invoice in Xero
* Setup and invoice with an expense in Xero

### Stand up

The team used to have a daily stand-up. This was replaced by asynchronous update on the stand-up Slack channel in the following format:

*Plan
*Recap
*Blockers ( is there something getting in the way for you to complete your way)
*Availability

### Trello

* Trello “Trello is used by some teams to managed tasks. If you are joining a team that uses Trello then you will be added to the board. If you have not used Trello before please [click here]( /https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xky48zyL9iA ) to learn more about it.
