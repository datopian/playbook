# Onboarding Guide

## Intention

*The intention of this Onboarding Guide is to fulfil on the following user story.*

As an Onboardee I want a simple step by step process to get set up (that I can do largely on my own) so that I am ready to go (and know I am ready to go) and feel part of the team. 

## Welcome!

Welcome to Datopian! üöÄ üë©‚ÄçüöÄ

Reflective of our Zen philosophy and we have designed the onboarding process to be largely self-service so you can set yourself up at your pace.

## Prerequisites 

Before we get to the onboarding proper there are some essential pre-quisites you need to do to get set up.

You can do all of these in advance of your first day with us and we request you do all of these before your Welcome Call so you get the maximum out of that.

:::tip
We want your feedback as new joiners! Be critical, tell us what does not work or what isn‚Äôt obvious!

We recommend noting ALL questions that arise and sharing with us in a Google Doc or HackMD. Bonus points for pull requests on the handbook itself!
:::

1. Login in to your Datopian email account and check it. See below.
2. Setup accounts on the systems. See below. Make sure you do this **before** you do next steps!
3. Add your details to the [Team Phonebook][phonebook] (aka Person DB)
4. Notify the Onboarder that you have added accounts in team phonebook so that they can add you to relevant systems
5. Setup your laptop -- install relevant software.

### Your Datopian Email

We have created a Datopian email for you. You should already have received an email about this with details of how to sign in and set your password.

If you haven't already: sign in and set your password.

#### 2FA 

For best practice security reasons, we recommend 2FA on all Datopian Google Accounts.

To enable 2FA for your account, ensure you are logged in to your Datopian account, and follow the steps here:

If you do not know what 2fa is, do not worry! You can also read more about 2fa:

To support your use of 2fa, we recommend installing Authenticator on your smartphone:

### Systems we use

Create an account on each of these. Please make sure you set up Gravatar first. For items marked with a `*` please add your account id to the phone book.

* Gravatar - https://gravatar.com. **Do this before anything else so your gravatar is used on the other accounts.** You create a gravatar so that your profile picture will show up automatically on your profile on other systems. Add your Datopian email and *all* the email(s) you will use on other accounts. For example, if you are signed up or plan to sign up to Gitlab with your personal email rather than your organization email then also add that email address to your gravatar.
* Github - https://www.github.com
* Gitlab - https://gitlab.com/
