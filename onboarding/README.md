# Onboarding Guide

## Intention

*The intention of this Onboarding Guide is to fulfil on the following user story.*

As an Onboardee I want a simple step by step process to get set up (that I can do largely on my own) so that I am ready to go (and know I am ready to go) and feel part of the team. 

## Start your onboarding

*We want your feedback as new joiners! Be critical, tell us what does not work, what isn’t obvious!*

1. **Login in to your email account.**

2. Note ALL questions that arise in a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/) during reading the handbook.

3. **Setup accounts on the systems.** See System We Use below. Make sure you do this **before** you do next steps!

4. Add contact details to [Team Phonebook][phonebook] 

5. Email and notify the Onboarder that you have added accounts in team phonebook so that they can add you to relevant systems

6. Read about your work processes for the job you do.

7. Go through work “processes” in more detail; This depends on the accountability the Onboardee will assume; E.g.

    * Work sprints
    * Kanban management 
    * Practice on Gitlab (acceptance criteria, checklist, closing issues…)
    * How to take meeting notes on operation meeting notes

## Systems we use

Create an account on each of these. Please make sure you set up Gravatar first. For items marked with a `*` please add your account id to the phone book.

* Gravatar - https://gravatar.com. **Do this before anything else so your gravatar is used on the other accounts.** We set this up so that your profile picture will show up automatically on your profile on other systems. Add *all* the email(s) you will use on other accounts. For example, if you plan to sign up to Trello with your personal email rather than your organization email then also add that email address to your gravatar.
* Github - https://www.github.com **Please tell your onboarder your github handle so we can add you**
* Gitlab - https://gitlab.com/ **Please tell your onboarder your gitlab handle so we can add you**

## Setting up Google Drive

After setting up your email address, you will have access to **GSuite**, and of course, [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/).

The Onboarder will grant you access to relevent Team Drives, so you can access and store the information / documents you require.

* Any new documents / sheets /presentations you create should be created in the appropriate folder in the Team Drive, **not your personal drive**. This speaks to our open and collaborative working culture. 
* If you require access to files that you currently don't have access to, please reach out to your Onboarder.

### Style Guide

Set up google docs to use our default styles: [ Handbook Style Guide section ][styleguide]

[styleguide]: /guide/#style-guide

### E-Mail Signature
Please implement this [E-mail signature template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gpw5zucdlA_tU5geFpIs89AxuJ0is8kMEh6mIDkttnY/edit) into your gmail account


## Using the Calendar

It is expected that you keep your calendar up to date, so that if it shows as free, that means a colleague can add a meeting during that period. For more information please check the [Guide Section](https://handbook.datopian.com/guide/#our-principles) in the Handbook.


### Getting paid and claiming expenses

Please read the [ Getting Paid ](https://handbook.datopian.com/guide/#getting-paid) and the [ Expenses ](https://handbook.datopian.com/guide/#expenses)  sections of the handbook. 

### Stand up

The team used to have a daily stand-up. This was replaced by asynchronous update on the stand-up on Google chats in the Standup channel in the following format:

* Plan
* Recap
* Blockers (is there something getting in the way for you to complete your tasks)
* Availability
