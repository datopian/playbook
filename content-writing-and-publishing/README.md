# The Content Writing & Publication Process at Datopian
 
## Document Introduction 

Datopian has a variety of services and products that are offered to our clients. Marketing these are important for brand building and establishing Datopian as world leaders in data services. It also strengthens our relationship with our clients and helps with our outreach to new potential clients. 
 
This document outlines the content publication process at Datopian across multiple channels. If you encounter an issue that is not covered by this project, open an issue on the Bizdev tracker and tag one of the current reviewers (@annabelvandaalen or @paulwalsh.)
 
 
## Content Production Overview

* Datopian produces different types of content (such as blog posts, case studies, feature updates etc.) and some of these types follow a template.
* Our written content aids client and potential client understanding of what we do and the sorts of topics we are engaged in.
* The content production is a collective responsibility.  
* Datopian has a [master spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fa6cxSnqyMMheIvpgWwYiDS6T-n5NFKDAT-txWRjVHc/edit#gid=0) that tracks our content pipeline and status.
 
 
## The Writing Process

### Overview

This section provides guidance on how to structure written content depending on the type of content being produced. Some content types require a specific template. Please see the guidance below for information on each content type, including structure, audience, tone and content (complete with examples!).
 
### Checklist

* Create an issue on the Editorial Board (note: the editorial board should **only be used for works in progress** so that other Datopians can collaborate with you - any content ideas for future posts should be logged in the [master spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fa6cxSnqyMMheIvpgWwYiDS6T-n5NFKDAT-txWRjVHc/edit#gid=0)).
* Draft the article, tweet or Blog (including a list of tags for the article).
* If any of your content contains terms that you think would make interesting additions to the glossary, add them on GitLab here: https://gitlab.com/datopian/core/datopian.com/-/tree/master/site/glossary.
* Make sure your content ends with the following paragraph about what we do in italics and with links embedded:
 
_Want to work with Datopian? We empower government and enterprise to unlock the potential lying dormant in their data through outstanding data management strategy and implementation. Check our [website](https://www.datopian.com/) for more information or [contact us](https://www.datopian.com/contact/)._
 
* Make sure that you add the license at the bottom of the page: © Datopian (CC Attribution-Sharealike (by-sa)).
* Create the abstract or intro for the article on our social media platforms, such as LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter.
* Ensure that links and background information are provided in the issue created for the article.

## Content Structure & Templates

### Client Interview
Interviews are unstructured to allow the interviewer room to respond spontaneously to points made by the client. However, it is good to keep in mind the aim of your interview and any key pieces of information you need to find out.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Template</th>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Tone</th>
    <td>When written up, the questions should be phrased informally to reflect the natural flow of a conversation. However, they should not include spoken mannerisms such as ‘um’, ‘yeah’, ‘right’ etc. You should feel free to paraphrase questions to allow for easy reading.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Example</th>
    <td>[Interview with OECD](https://www.datopian.com/blog/2020/05/12/oced-case-study/)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Case Study

Case studies have their own separate section on the website and should all be structured in the same manner. They aim to show a client’s journey from first encountering a problem and hiring Datopian to our current projects together. They should draw attention to the ways in which Datopian has helped our client through bespoke solutions.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Template</th>
    <td>Please use the [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vLf-fcHc9rhgYcsLP2HfjovPhUUV4Dgh1hs48azx5HI/edit#heading=h.vkr66n97gatf)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Tone</th>
    <td>Case studies are not blogs and articles, but structured pieces of content that are much more formal in tone.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Example</th>
    <td>[Gates Foundation Case Study](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R4nvc4DDZEhp9ZQFTKMAdm1AfVTUFtaSrGtOzSiEU8w/edit#heading=h.m1gy4aodpy3)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
 
### Briefing

Briefings are split into two types: expert and technical. Technical briefings are specific to certain technologies or very technical in character. Expert briefings are more general in scope and tackle wider data themes. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Template</th>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Tone</th>
    <td>Formal but with room for the writer’s own voice and writing style to shine through.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Audience</th>
    <td>Both briefings should **assume little prior knowledge**. This means that writers should make an effort to ensure articles are accessible enough for anyone to understand, while still containing an element of depth to make them interesting for more expert audiences. In a nutshell, this means going into as much detail as possible while also explaining that detail.</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>3a. Technical Briefings</th>
    <td>Includes: articles on CKAN, software, programming, file formats, data specifications, DMS.</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <th>3b. Expert Briefings</th>
    <td>Includes: thought-leader posts, opinion pieces, general data posts.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

_N.b. An article on DMS could potentially be either an expert briefing or a technical briefing. The difference between them is: Technical Briefings focus on specific technologies and technical explanations, eg. might explain how a DMS functions, whereas Expert Briefings are more general in scope, eg. might discuss the benefits of DMS for enterprise._

### Announcement/ update

Announcements are split into two types: feature & functionality updates (templated) and projects going live updates (non-templated). Both types of announcement should include (where possible): demos, screenshots or diagrams; a link to the project; a call to action; a link to the GitHub code. The announcement should begin with a brief summary of the feature/project.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Template</th>
    <td>Please use the [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17BHiYhUA7f-K4OIn2Plc-gfdn-69g6NaJXu40VYfqyo/edit#).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Audience</th>
    <td>Especially in the case of feature & functionality templates, we can assume some prior knowledge. Because these are aimed at clients already using the feature, announcements should go into technical detail about key aspects. However, they should not contain information about the codebase - this can be found through the link to GitHub.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Tone</th>
    <td>Formal with enthusiastic language, eg. we are proud to be working with/we are excited to announce etc.</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>4a. Feature & functionality updates</th>
    <td>Under the ‘why this new feature?’ heading in the template, it is important to frame the feature in terms of why we did it for a certain client with the use cases X, Y and Z. Check with the project manager whether the client can be named - if not, describe the company eg. ‘a fortune 100 pharmaceutical company’.</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <th>4b. Projects going live updates</th>
    <td>If possible, it would be great to include a quote from the client.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### About Us and Our Culture

Datopians are encouraged to write blog posts on any aspect of Datopian culture or methods. These could be casual or philosophical in scope. Posts could range from: discussions on agile project delivery, different approaches to remote working, philosophical musings, or how we approach software development.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Template</th>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Tone</th>
    <td>Informal and lighthearted.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Example</th>
    <td>[Remote working at Datopian](https://www.datopian.com/blog/2020/03/24/tips-on-remote-work/#use-your-video-for-meetings-whenever-possible)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### ‘Hobby-blogger’ posts

‘Hobby-blogger’ posts aim to give Datopians the space to discuss personal projects and views that are loosely linked to Datopian’s work. These could include tech/software builds or responses to data-world developments. Photos are mandatory! :)

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Template</th>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Tone</th>
    <td>Informal and lighthearted.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Example</th>
    <td>[Running a scraping platform](https://www.datopian.com/blog/2020/01/08/running-a-scraping-platform-at-google-cloud/#the-architecture).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Newsletter

Datopian produces two types of external newsletter: a bi-annual update on our client projects and more frequent feature newsletters. Feature newsletters mainly consist of interviews with Datopians, clients or industry professionals.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Template</th>
    <td>In progress.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Tone</th>
    <td>Formal.</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>7a. Bi-annual newsletter</th>
    <td>This must include an opening word from the leadership team (Rufus, Paul, Esteban) and a short overview of all ongoing client projects.</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <th>7b. Feature newsletters</th>
    <td>Feature newsletters could be anything - we are open to suggestions! Generally speaking though, many will take the form of interviews on a certain topic.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Reviews

Datopian does not currently write any reviews and these are not a priority at present. However, this route is open for exploration at some point in the future.

## How to post on the blog

### Overview

Posting on the blog requires GitLab and Visual Studio Code. If you haven’t already downloaded Visual Studio Code, you can find it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Working with this software requires you to do some basic coding, but you by no means need to be a programmer to learn how. Simply follow the steps below! We would recommend **looking at how other articles have been coded** at each coding step to make sure you understand how to implement the instructions.
 
1. Open the [repository](https://gitlab.com/datopian/core/datopian.com) on GitLab. Click on the blue ‘clone’ button and copy the second URL.
2. Open Visual Studio Code and go to the Terminal tab at the top → select ‘New Terminal’. The terminal is the part of the software where you write instructions.
3. In the terminal, type in git clone followed by the copied link, like this: `git clone https://gitlab.com/datopian/core/datopian.com.git`. Press Enter on your keyboard.
4. In the explorer tab on the left, find the blog folder and right click on it. Select New Folder. Name the folder using the naming convention yyyy-mm-dd-your-blog-post-title (Example: 2019-03-01-viderum-renaming-to-datopian).
5. Now right click on the folder you just created. Select New File and name it README.md. This is the file you will use to create your article.
6. Now you need to upload your thumbnail image to this folder. This is the image that will show up next to your post on the blog homepage. To do this, save the photo to your device and name it (using dashes to separate words instead of spaces) and drag and drop it to the new folder you just created in Visual Studio Code. The photo should now be in your blog post folder alongside the README.md file.
7. Now you need to upload any other photos for your blog post to Visual Studio Code. Staying in the explorer tab, go to Vuepress → Public → Assets → Image → Blog. Save the images you need to your laptop and drag and drop these into this folder (there should be lots of images already there).
8. Go back to your README.md file and add the following code to the document (this should stay at the top of the document):
9. Fill out the relevant information. It should now look something like this:

```
---
layout: post
title: article title
authors: author/s
date: yyyy-mm-dd
tags: [“X”, “Y”, “Z”]
image: /assets/img/blog/image-name.jpg
---
```
 
10. Under this, leave a line and write the following code: 
```
<!-- more -->.
```

11. Under this, paste the text of your article.

12. To add photos, use the following code: 


```
<figure>
	<img src=”./image-name.jpg” alt=”give your image a name”>
	<figcaption style=”text-align: center><a href=”link to image source”>image description for article</a><figcaption>
</figure>
```

 13. Format your text using Markdown.

 14. In the terminal, type `git push` and press Enter.

 15. Type `git pull` and press Enter.

 16. Type `git add -A` and press Enter.

 17. Type `git commit -m “[blog post][m]: blog post on X”` and press Enter.

 18. Type `git push` and press Enter.

 19. Go back to the repository on GitLab and refresh the page. You should see your commit message and a completion status circle next to it. N.b. the circle should be blue when your post is uploading - this takes about 5 mins. When this turns to a green tick, your post is live on the blog. If the circle becomes a red cross, then there was a problem with your code.
 
## The Broadcasting Process
